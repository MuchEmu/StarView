Testing 123 Starview what happens if I’m going to mail a minute and talking really fast to get excited about this idea testing I got everybody but one of those words


Yes I can use it today Jessi Jordan on our anniversary trip I am going to tell you the story of Starview as a whole list today as we flew over Roswell New Mexico on our way to San Francisco from Austin Texas cool by the way I’ve been working on Starview for over 10 years and one of the inspirations that I have drawn heavily from is Mars attacks and as I was doing a quick little bit of writing on the flight I looked at the speed of the story of Mars attacks and was inspired to rap how much action happens instantly if you look at the story of Mars attacks


OK I will tell you what I believe is the kind of sequence of the story beats my idea has always started with sputnik and so the story happens between October and like January 1957 through the very very tiny start at 58 and probably around this time maybe a little bit later than now because right now this is the first week of October maybe maybe after Halloween not sure exactly when to the day is set but it opens in a very very very calm way sputnik is orbiting and it is all in and beeping and that’s nothing unusual about that after you see sputnik we immediately arrive at the star view Drive in which is north of Los Angeles in the Hollywood Hills nestled at the fire break trail area of Griffith just down the mountain from deserve a Tory up and over the hill from Bronson Canyon came at Starview the movie terror from outer space is playing at the drive-in theater and we see scenes of terror from outer space which recycles V2 rocket footage as a cheesy rocket it recycles literal hubcapsAnd other incredibly cheesy things for science fiction and there might be like exclamations of high I can see the zipper on a monster might be a monster that super super super cheesy that could then be reflected as a real creature later on in the story the terror from outer space sequence doesn’t have much story beat to it it just sets the table that you’re at Starbucks the movie is interrupted as it’s interrupted by the star the star view theater system being interrupted by the BP peep of Sputnik Joe is introduced being frustrated at the Russians for interrupting his movie experience because he has crafted an early early handheld transistor radio stereo system sound and it just so happens to use the frequency that sputnik uses as his radio transmitter that’s the happenstance that connects Starview in Spanish and he speaks in a way that it’s like literally every orbit during the night it ruins that section of his audio show and he’s like the sole worker at the drive-in he’s the manager lena is there with him at the start of you and so she also knows that it is always happening it fades as it goes out of orbit range as it continues this particular night it beeps and that sort of thing and we may see that in the first feature and then the second feature may start without being shown it might be implied that there at the second picture of the double feature which allows it to be the Rocky horror science fiction double feature tonight so you go back to sputnik and immediately a green sphere pushes past the camera and slams into sputnik and enveloped it completely The antenna arms are sticking outside of this sphere of gel in microgravity in orbit and a ferocious giant eyeball with tentacles for a body underneath the eye and in the middle of the tentacles of like six arms is a like razor-sharp mess of things as a mouth directly in the base walk on its mouth so this thing hurdles past and as soon as it hurdles pass you see like those eyeballs like emote that it’s sneaking away because being chased by this giant ice preacherDo you see the little bit of news start to kind of reach out like it’s a arm and kind of in position where I look like an arm for size and then it makes a water droplet effect and you see that I start to panic is that he does not want to have that arm extends feel like alert the iron creature that is just gone by and the little piece of news goes blue and floats in the space next to sputnik which the eye creature sees because it’s means I around like the ISR on and it just freaks out spins around and just comes right after sputnik which is this green blob at this point in time with eyes at which time the green who’s ball and so they are immediately screaming down toward Southern California lights flashing bright laser green color astroid looking thing like a meteorite that’s the bright green variety that you’ve seen perhaps and following right behind it is the crazy eye creature right in the eye creature gets flame reentry flying on top of like it’s surface and it might there might be some sort of interesting like alien science words it’s capsule is tears or something right there’s no actual space ship for this I creatures of the floating eyeball monster and the other is its own thing it’s a spaceship they can protect sputnik so they’re barreling towards Southern California because this is happening on the because this is happening there on the western hemisphere it’s out of direct line of site USSR so unless they actually had radio listener station to say probably dead but who knows what will assume that it would take a little bit of word of mouth to say suddenly up any longer and if that trigger happens because sure enough sputnik is the opening right now so you see the news covered sputnik screaming towards earth following behind immediately is this a creature comment of like red orange and yellow fire with the eye creature inside of that perfectly fine without any trouble because the alien monsters andCut back to starve you Joe has had the movie interrupted again his sputnik is there above Starkey except this time it didn’t stop it’s still beeping and it’s and the cars are honking in time with the sputnik because people are unhappy because the only draw for this rickety old Starview drive-in theaters that they’re in super radio sound because they could go anywhere else in Hollywood but his radio sound is the big draw and so they’re paying customers are flipping out because he can’t hear the movie which is kind of a joke in itself because you know the second of a double feature movie so because sputnik keeps beeping on those radio waves that are sent out from the drive-in theater radio tower which is connected to the concession stand is where Joe’s radio room is and it’s basically just a platform there and maybe an umbrella or something for whatever the weather gives them as he’s up there and it keeps beeping and the crowd is impatient and from behind him you see little dots of light coming from the stars and one is green and one is orange red and the green one gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until a beach ball of translucent glowing luminous glow in the dark green laser green surrounding sputnik itself ask JoeI’m so close that he leans over the railing looking at it just completely he can’t believe it and immediately following the same reentry course is a flaming eyeball that nearly knocked him off the 
tower like an immediate succession like a amazing action sequence the entire drive-in theater irrupt in panic because two giant things of comments have just literally landed without any explosion and so there is honking is running the screaming and Joe looks up and the entire theater screen is cut in half with glowing green in Fire in physical geography from Griffith Observatory entry angle through the screen into Bronson K theater goes panic and that’s it for the night we cut to Joe and Lena trying to make sense of what to do lean is a very supportive partner to Jo Jo’s it’s like single proprietor of this place and there may be stuff wrapped into that like it may be a legacy of his or something or whatever he’s getting a little consolation but the whole time sputnik keeps beeping and when Lena comes in to talk to him because he’s totally like my Theater is destroyed she brings in one of the wireless radio receivers and as she brings the wireless radio receiver and they realize that the signal triangulates and that they then they’re like hold on hold on step back three steps and it changes pitch and then volume and so it confirms what Joe kind of thought because he could hear it the volume changes louder and louder as it approaches from space and he was in the mode of not getting hit by these two meteorites and so he’s finally put it together that they can try and go out to see what happened and they also know where it was so they gotta go investigate they go investigate and they see things on fire all sorts of stuff all the way through directly to the cave and they know the cave because at that point in time in the 50s this caveAn interesting idea to explore if that Caveland was part of Lena’s family or something like that so maybe they have some sort of rights there and that plays into the fact that they drive to the Cave and they see that the trajectory takes it directly into the cave opening and Leo just wants to go for and Joe has no idea what’s going on but they know that the sputnik noises like ultra right there and that makes them think that sputnik is crashed there which would be obvious that they can’t believe it’s still beeping they argue a little bit about you can’t just go in you don’t know what is that thing right because at this point in time no one has actually seen a photograph of sputnik in the West hey functionally do not know it’s so as they go in the cave they see sputnik they’re on the ground like an Indiana Jones McGuffin like path is cleared the little baby Cal L Superman ship has landed to that same pattern of dirt as for the ground and it’s literally the Bronson cave from back in the Batcave and that sort of thing and Andy Junior’s who are there so we can know exactly what it looks like to draw it out and it’s gonna be amazing it’s covered in the green and you can see that passed it there’s a cylinder that has been bored through probably 20 feet wide which is what it really isn’t it in the physical place by that I Joe saw it and he’s like you can’t go in there without me because the comet had an eyeball I think it was an eyeball right and so they go and they see sputnik and they’re trying to keep their distance because it’s glowing green it sounds like the danger right they then hear footsteps approaching in the gravel because it’s this old gravel pit that has this tunnel cave and so they’re trying to hide in here walks in a guy in a space suit full on mercury style pre-mercury by about 5 to 7 years flight suit full on helmet on probably chrome helmet and probably silver suit but maybe black I’m not certain yet so they they literally say something or some thing because they see this glowing orb of shoes which is now not blob and as soon as this new individual arrives they’re trying to hide but there’s no place to go to board there’s no hiding spots and then as soon as that astronaut looking guy arrives just before they get ready to say something the astronaut is like stand back in English word must be an American astronaut is the idea and so they they just pretty much freeze The eye creature breaks through the opening of the tunnel and just roars at the green blob and the new 32 legged creatures that are there in the tunnel to kind of like attacked is green the green orb blob thing forms up and begins to run/wish/news to the side and the IT creature attack and rushes through the wall of the tunnel and grits like splash dues and they go through the wall the tunnel playing off something that you don’t see what it is ricochet up into spaceAnd it’s just absolute silent quiet except it sputnik is now completely uncovered and it’s just sitting there perfect on the floor of the tunnel functioning but not orbiting beeping perfectly in time and that’s as good of any place to break the course right but we’re just getting started Lena immediately says who are you to this astronaut and


The is sitting there in the car I creature has just chased the issues crashing through the side of the tunnel wall and immediately the astronaut chases after them yelling don’t break my shit and I can’t catch up with this crazy alien speed of this chase that’s happening and he can see them playing off of a silver sphere dome and shoot off into space and they’re gone back to Sputnik and John Ludena are discussing what do they do this must be sputnik right they’ve never seen this must be It are arrests but they’re clearly being brought to kind of a traditional if you come with me the feds are whatever that point Lena absolutely establishes salvage rights and in a really fun and not glib but very forward way like this is this is ours we found it we have the right somehow or other and then there’s some banter of them what are you talking about is back into space there’s gonna be a nuclear war because in this storyline the idea is that as soon as the sputnik beeps are not picked up over the USSR Cold War The tunnels literally connect to aria 19 which is the scientific based installation area 51 style underneath the secret base and it just so happens in like that connected universe that’s very small way but Lena‘s dad is the general in charge of that installation and so there’s like the 1950s interplay when they finally get back to there with news about sputnik or physically take it one of the two connects to that yes yes and so she might know more than she says when she says it’s salvage rights that it’s a possibility that she has a legal standing right so that’s that’s really interesting dynamic of this like in this world if Sputnik lands in this tunnel if it’s owned by Lincoln Center as they are being marched to area 19 right they don’t know it’s area 19 they don’t know anything and I think Lena doesn’t know about the insulation they’re being marched through these tunnels and it becomes more and more 1940s 1950s military installation like missile silo and more science fiction it instead of just being rock quarry goes in as they’re walking by the astronaut might have to walk them past a flying saucer under a tarp really likely that because this is the push comes to shove moment they are able to discover the saucer with the astronaut and they’re asking questions like I’m not gonna say anything about that she’s doing that right so like there’s some banter interplay about the saucer set the audience and Joe and Lena know that there is a flying saucer and this astronaut won’t answer questions about it which means they know about it so they get to the area 19 and this is where I have a decision point that is the last story decision point that I don’t have I don’t yet have in mind how the dynamic with the The couple of Joe and Lena and the dad I don’t know I don’t know the parent child not knowing that connection between Lena and her dad I don’t know if they’re young enough that she basically gets grounded or if it’s like I told you to stop hanging out with this loser a ride but that seems really like science proficiency as the thing for all of these characters I want everybody to be a very able and enabled mind of being very fun trip to the girl and the talk to the general and this story connectors I’m not sure if they’re physically holding sputnik or feel like we’ve seen it and he’s like why did you leave it unguarded and the back or if they physically take sputnik with them they might think it’s atomic or something like that already maybe they have it and they get reprimanded or maybe they don’t have it and it gets stolen because of how many different stories that I have so the connection to back to the story that I feel like I have soul is the entire idea is that because sputnik is still functioning and has been stolen by this crazy celestial situation they need to get it back in to orbit before the next rotation of the orbit circles around and Russia the Soviet union does not discover that it’s missing we’re on the clock we might not yet know that but it would make sense to be able to say hey this happened anybody set it up earlier every movie double feature it happens twice so you know it’s a like clockwork you got it there’s another amount of time you have the length of a movie to get this thing back into space and it’s probably much much faster because you have like half of that and you gotta get it faster than it was really tough with the pre-manned space flight stuff so I have a connection that Hass to happen there’s a bit of green news that is left on either sputnik itself or from the is it the news must hitch a ride from the area of sputnik and it’s just a little tiny bit of green ooze and then there is likely that there’s going to be right in that that could be the awesome I love the idea that there’s enough of a pause beat that Joe and Orlena but probably Joe with the news on him could who’s eats the popcorn by totally grabbing it absorbing it and then immediately quadrupled in size and then like Glamis onto a candy bar or something like that and suddenly has eyes and can talk and Joe’s like whoa whoa whoa you got a snap you gotta stop eating all my food and maybe even fully envelops the concession stand when it turns around and he’s grown grown grown right so like the news has grown exponentially immediately because of popcorn popcorn is the thing and then maybe it has The classic concession stand cartoon imagery floating inside the news that Selena has eyeballs and so this is Bob the Bob Bob the blob is that little blue that is left behind and may also be the little blue that went blue that caused the creature to turn back around and attack sputnik because they thought they got away with it and depending on how much story I need I have all of the information about how Bob the blob is fully aware of the fact that it’s 1 billion living organism bunch below be right in the news is the official thing that it is I feel that the Bob blob character is either need to go eventually back to become part of the main use or was a self-aware little piece from that news that had picked up earth radio signals of all of the science fiction media and was the Superfan that brought the news on its escape to sputnik because it’s the first human satellite and that means to the blob blob that the human champions who always vanquish the bad aliens in these stories that are transferring to the University were true heroic acts and that he could be saved by his folks literally at the cave that he lands next to serve you what the blob thinks is the space hero story is true which is crazy to me because we’re already at that point where it’s like a conspiracy from outer space at this point really what I’m hoping to do so that’s an aside about Bob the Bob that could happen later story it doesn’t have to happen this next time but if Bob the blob can be an ally immediately to Joe there is a sequence later or Bob the blob can be Joe’s helmet in space which is a wonderful image and a wonderful story of it and so let’s suppose that John Ludena take a 45 minute if Joe goes to the theater and discovers Bob Bob while Lena is either being reprimanded or maybe go out somewhere else or something like that there needs to be a way for Joe and Bob to go back to the area 19 and there’s depends on how much there is the possibility that Joe gets like thrown out of every 19 nothing right and then he goes back to see the spot and maybe that’s where he discovers Bob Bob little bit of food left over something like that lotta different connector points missing there I wanna explore every nightI have a mission in area 51 and we can see that this is all happening at work within the conspiracy because we have this earth critical mission that’s the angle of attack that I want for the story so that I can have all of the fun stuff in the back I know you have prototype space capsules it would eventually become the real not from this area so the plan to get sputnik back into space is literally the end of the adventure and they’re on the clock there is a time limit it’s go time and so I’m trying to figure out how to get it connected to the next scene that I pick up the kind of the final act the rocket that is inside the missile silo deep the missile silo deepIs one of those Redstone rockets so very very light rocket those are the smallest of the small original NASA rocket so it’s one of the earliest ones to fit in the timeline you can hold the Mercury cancel on the top and we might be able to hedge it to be a little tiny bit bigger and then also it has an ability if we wish to have the saucer fold up its wings like little shards and kind of make it interesting housing looking thing underneath the castle that plays into this action sequence the original sequence was Joe hast to get onto the rocket to try to to and Joe wants to board the rocket in order to safely it was the original idea and this is Mack and Lena have been kidnapped by and I don’t really care to kidnap storeroom I’m more interested in a chase exactly and and I’m fully in the zone of it might be Lena wants something and she takes the place of Joe but there’s a catwalk fist fight trying to fight the astronaut 




character who is trying to not let them get onto the rocket not a ferocious battle but in the battle the astronauts helmet is either broken or knocked off and we meet the astronaut who is like The classic gray alien probably light blue gray with black shiny eyes very 90s Roswell alien in a mercury spacesuit so that character sees that in the original sequence Joe has jumped onto the rocket and is climbing and hanging on the side of the Redstone rocket in really cool angles of sequence and very Indiana Jones as action there’s a countdown happening there’s a little bit of smoke and steam happening because it’s straight up in a rocket launch countdown goes down and Joe’s hanging on wearing his shirt and tie not even his hanging on timer that the timer countdown goes to zero and then the elevator sucks lifting the rocket instead of the launch from inside the tube so it’s like still hanging on the side of the rocket at that point in time politics the astronaut name X – 15 saves Joe and pulls him into either the capsule or the saucer portion of this rocket so that he can survive and launch with




 so you have Joe you have Pollux and you have sputnik on the rocket launching because they have to get sputnik back into orbit Bob could be connected to Joe this whole time walkie-talkie radio that is made from the actual drive-in speak of his network of like 100° it is the start of a special feature I love the idea of Lena being bored already somehow or I love your idea of flip-flopping Joe with Lyna Lena Trident catch along side because maybe Joe volunteers to do this mission or something who knows but there’s some Rollercade adventure to get them all on a rocket launch to space from Victoria and the launch 




and then get to orbit and the characters out of their castle in orbit and they get it going and it’s still beeping they tested and that’s why he has the radio receiver with him and everything like that 




when the iron creature returns because it sees Bob the block again and it sees sputnik again 


and now there’s other creatures still interfering again 


and there’s an action sequence of them protecting Sputnik fighting the alien a creature that’s flipping with tentacles and hit them and they’re spinning in orbit and stuff like that and 




eventually they overcome the eye creature and manage to either capture it that they’ve been trying to talk about the whole time avoiding this nuclear war 


so interspersed throughout the sequence is the USSR speaking about where is sputnik where is the satellite the sick with lost the signal what’s going on and then they they’re looking at their watches and they’re looking at their mission control timer they know it’s late so they didn’t get it in time and so the war machine rubs up and we might be able to play with the idea of the Russian commander who disobeyed the orders to launch missiles right and so there may be able to make a Russian hero a Russian every man be a hero the way we actually have no real history and


 as they’re getting closer and closer and closer to an actual nuclear attack perhaps maybe there would be a kind of a countdown sequence


 at the end of that that is relieved by the beat beat beat coming back in


 and it’s on the correct course of the wrong time now and so they they stand down but somethings messed up and so that is going to add to intriguing future 


the Russians turn in


 next to them is the astronaut 
and they say


 how did this happen and that astronaut says
 I think I know who helped them… thank you for listening the title of this song two minutes

BRirng star viewintoo a place where the story is naturally driven by the actions and motivations of the cataracters


If Lina’s dad is the general in charge of the Area 19 section of A.S.T.R.O,he could be the driver for her to be the Ovid star he wants her to be.  She might want nothing to do with it, and instead want to be something        for herself that isn’t possible for the time.


Joe might be transferred fromRoswell,to a new assigneement in LA.  This could be how he will be alone managing the star view, and also have a childhood history as a kiddo with Lina running around the observatory in the 1950s.


Maria the rbotFutura, the dark Maria from Metropolis can be a prototype ring worked on in Area 19.  Lina may bring a few pieces of the robot shell to incorporate integer armor for space voyages.


Specific, boots and gauntlets, perhaps the gloves and belt for Lina’s 1950s spacesuit.


Metropolis from the llate 20s and 30s would be 20-30 years LF at the time, making it a retro science fi to the retro sci fi.


So would Flash Gordon,the newspaper strips,and the buck rogerrs era ships.  Pulp heroes would be 10-15 years old, and Superman and Batman would be just fresh in the minds eye of the US since 15-20 years as well.


TV would be arriving, and the live transmission of video images is as new as radio was for the retro sci fi to them.


Radar and laser, the television broadcast, the first artificial satellites,these are the new tech pieces, driven by the first electronic brains,memories, storage and computer systems.
