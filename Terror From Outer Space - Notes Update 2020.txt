The BZZT! is the alien attacking the drive in.
Attacks during the final battle of the film?
The screams of the patrons are different from the screams of the movie (The balloons show them)


Attacking the drive in to get lina?  to get the radio source?  who knows




 me:  Hey you!
 Jessi:  me?
 me:  yes, you!
I've got a date tonight and I hope she's up for some nostalgic Sherlockian banter
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eeweathers/thumbson-and-mort?ref=friends_backed
 Sent at 8:43 PM on Monday
 Jessi:  cool
 me:  what is your evening schedule?  I just got andyjunior to bed in 8 minutes, flat!
 Jessi:  an hour or so
 me:  you are free in an hour or so?  or have only an hour or so?
 Jessi:  i'm free in an hour or so
 Sent at 8:48 PM on Monday
 me:  perfect.  I'll be around, love!
 Jessi:    
 me:  I think i've had a breakthru on the storyline for Terror From Outer Space
yet again,lol
 Jessi:  tell meeee
 Sent at 8:51 PM on Monday
 me:  Ok get this:
 Sent at 8:53 PM on Monday
 me:  A small boy of seven or so years old plays at Griffith Observatory with a blonde girl he's never met before.
they have a bag of popcorn to share.
they play until the girls dad, the sarge assigned to the observatory, comes by and gruffly scoops her up and away.
you see, there's been some very strange blips on the advanced radar they have in the secret area under the observatory, where the boy's father works.
 Sent at 8:56 PM on Monday
 me:  the father and son don't go home that night, February 25, 1942 because of the high alert status the secret base has
the boy falls alseep in the planetarium, bored out of his mind waiting for his dad to get done with work
 Sent at 8:58 PM on Monday
 me:  at 2am, air sirens go off, and explosions fill the air of Los Angeles as a Flying Saucer hovers on a slow flight path over the Hollywood hills, surrounded by shells and flak from all sides
the little boy sneaks to the balcony because he can't believe he's seeing an ACTUAL flying saucer.
because of the noise he doesn't hear the little girl he met that afternoon scoot up next to him
this of course scares him, and he screams
she offers him some more popcorn, just like before.
the scream of a child bring the sarge and scientist running, as they were both dads with their kiddo in what they thought was the safest place in town- their secret science installation
after the Saucer disappears over the hills, they grab their respective kids, who never see each other again until 1959...
when Lina brings a bag of popcorn along when she meets Joe, who now works for the sarge guy his parent(s?) did
 Jessi:  :3
 me:  so they meet again for the second time in their mid 20's and it's awkward and fun and tingley
what do you think?  assertive heroine, sciency guy.  missing years of mystery that each have
 Sent at 9:05 PM on Monday
 Jessi:  yeah, i like it!

[10/14/12 9:07:59 PM] Jessi: Tell me more about your sci-fi ideas!
[10/14/12 9:08:52 PM] Andy Moore: well, I'm lost in a brainstorm about the tone/story arc that I'd like to have
[10/14/12 9:09:08 PM] Andy Moore: and I got to thinking about the era I'm setting it in
[10/14/12 9:09:19 PM] Andy Moore: and then I keep pushing back to the music side of things
[10/14/12 9:09:38 PM] Andy Moore: and sometimes it's a farce of a humor book, and sometimes super earnest sci fi
[10/14/12 9:09:53 PM] Andy Moore: like mixing flash gordon with MST3K
[10/14/12 9:10:13 PM] Andy Moore: it's like hummus and justin's hazelnut chocolate butter
[10/14/12 9:12:10 PM] Andy Moore: ubut I've locked in one nifty idea
[10/14/12 9:12:27 PM] Jessi: haha
[10/14/12 9:12:32 PM] Andy Moore: ALL the sci-fi B movies seem to exist in a 'real' Earth
[10/14/12 9:12:56 PM] Andy Moore: so that makes me feel like I can at least have the story take place in a real environment
[10/14/12 9:13:00 PM] Andy Moore: blah blah
[10/14/12 9:13:01 PM] Andy Moore: haha
[10/14/12 9:13:45 PM] Andy Moore: I also unearthed a folder of 11-year-old Andy drawings of a Star Trek/Battlestar Galactica clone I did in middle school
[10/14/12 9:14:00 PM] Andy Moore: and the robot space fighter pilot's name was 'Pollux'
[10/14/12 9:14:18 PM] Andy Moore: the eternal twin of gemini- so I think that might have to be the alien's name
[10/14/12 9:15:00 PM] Andy Moore: and he can stil be X-15, which I kinda geek out about
[10/14/12 9:16:40 PM] Andy Moore: and I did some extra-galactic light speed calculations, and since Pollux is 33 light years away, the timeline would work really well for the advent of high-frequency radio waves from the start of the 20th century to finally filter that far
[10/14/12 9:17:16 PM] Andy Moore: and I still love the idea of Sputnik being the 'panic button' for the aliens across the galaxy
[10/14/12 9:17:36 PM] Andy Moore: since they wouldn't worry TOO much about just a planet with radio capability
[10/14/12 9:18:07 PM] Andy Moore: hence the sending of just a random dude alien to Earth
[10/14/12 9:18:20 PM] Andy Moore: instead of an attack

#10 The Skyscraper Tumbles
"The Empire State Building crackled in flames as hundreds of workers were trapped inside the famous skyscraper. The attack took place at the end of a working day, just before men and women were to leave their offices to return to their families. Thousands of lives were lost as people fled for their cars, hoping to escape the flaming city. Autos piled onto the roads, with police completely helpless during the panic. Fires sprang up everywhere, as the saucers continued their assault on the city. The fire department was helpless because of the jammed roads. New York City was burning down and no one could do anything to help."
