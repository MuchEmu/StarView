Castor/Pollux chat to Jessi
[10/14/12 9:13:45 PM] Andy Moore: I also unearthed a folder of 11-year-old Andy drawings of a Star Trek/Battlestar Galactica clone I did in middle school
[10/14/12 9:14:00 PM] Andy Moore: and the robot space fighter pilot's name was 'Pollux'
[10/14/12 9:14:18 PM] Andy Moore: the eternal twin of gemini- so I think that might have to be the alien's name
[10/14/12 9:15:00 PM] Andy Moore: and he can stil be X-15, which I kinda geek out about
[10/14/12 9:16:40 PM] Andy Moore: and I did some extra-galactic light speed calculations, and since Pollux is 33 light years away, the timeline would work really well for the advent of high-frequency radio waves from the start of the 20th century to finally filter that far


Pollux wears a silver flight suit and a white helmet 
Sometimes wears a full black shiny helmet






Pollux and Castor are Twins/Clones/Representatives from their Solar Systems to keep the Earth Equilibrium and avoid an Atomic War that reaches the stars.
rying to fight the astronaut character who is trying to not let them get onto the rocket not a ferocious battle but in the battle the astronauts helmet is either broken or knocked off and we meet the astronaut who is like The classic gray alien probably light blue gray with black shiny eyes very 90s Roswell alien in a mercury spacesuit so that character sees that
________________
Character Profile: Castor
Castor is the twin of Pollux, a duplicate version that goes to the Soviet Union to help stave off a nuclear war.


R-15 could be the code name for Castor in Cyrilic

Character Profile: BL00P/Blop/Blep/Bob/OOP
THE Proteus-Class OOZE (NOT a BLOB or a slime!) A Proteus Ooze named B.L.O.O.P.


Billion Living Organism Organized Protean


The blob character is an ooze from outer space - ASTRO Names him Proteus because he’s a shapeshifter and a catalog of info.Oop the BLOOP the Protean is named after Proteus the elemental item in alchemy, the son of Poseidon.


BLOOP’s arrival, escape from the Eye Creatures and crash landing search for heroes on Earth is the Story of Star View and the impetus for the A.S.T.R.O. program to launch its first Redstone Reconnoisance Rocket (ASTRO R3-A) in 1957.


BLOP The Protean is a the particle of the blob who is the fan of all Science Fiction from Earth.
Armed with his encyclopedic knowledge of Science Fiction, Proteus guides the ooze to Earth because there are great heroes 


Can mimic human communication and project modulations in technology.  (examples include making a radio transmit ideas, acting as a lens cover for a projector to show ‘holographic images’ )


Saved Joe in space when the eye creature destroys his flight suit A-2 Helmet by forming a protective green sphere when Joe resists the Eye Creatures second attack on Sputnik!


The movie The Blob happens a few months after Star View, and the concept of Star Jelly and slime, blobs, ooze and other items were in science fiction writings!


Chased by any number of Aliens who seek to use the self-replecating blob creature as fuel, the Ooze makes


Dr. Zorba Torrey will mis-say everyone’s name- especially The OOZE

Battle of Los Angeles
Joe and Lina watch as a flying saucer lands in Griffith Park amid anti-aicraft artillery blasts in World War Two.


Roswell 1947
Pollux and Lt. Robinson scramble to help inspect a downed weather balloon in New Mexico. 


Star View 1957
Sputnik Launches
An alien battle above Earth crashes Sputnik into Los Angeles.  
Seeking refuge on Earth’s first orbital spacecraft, the OOZE is chased across the universe by A terrifying EYEBALL CREATURE from Triangulum.
Joe and Lina’s date is interrupted and The Star View Drive in is destroyed by the Alien Battle.
The Young couple discovers a crashed but still-beeping Sputnik, a 1940s flying saucer in storage, and the ASTRO scientific outpost hidden in the caves of Griffith Park. 
At the Hangar 19 of ASTRO base, we discover that there is an emergency: The Soviet Union must not discover that Sputnik is lost. If they do the Atomic Space War might begin.
They have to team up with Pollux-15, the Alien who crashed at Roswell in the 40s to return Sputnik into space before the Cold War breaking into an atomic war that destroys Earth and shatters the universe.
A piece of the living blob of Ooze seeks the heroes of earth’s science fiction… it tells the story of following the Earth heroes via a computer radar console. They name it “Oop”.
Oop the Protean grows after eating some leftover movie Theater Popcorn.
The mission launches a rocket through the Hollywood Sign, and returns via a flying saucer.


Growing in size to a basketball size, Proteus becomes a target for the the Eye Creature again. 
Blasting the Eye Creature with the radio ray in spce saves Sputnik, but the Eye Creature has damaged the Transmitter!


The Soviet’s Sputnik tracking lab does not get the signal at the expected time.  The USSR military brass thinks this is cause for alarm, and begins readiness for second-strike launches.  


The stakes were as large as the Earth itself. Any retaliation launch from The Soviet Union would be considered a first strike, and the Mutually Assured Destruction plans would make the loss of signal a global catastrophe!


Pollux reaches Castor via ESP and tells them that the battery is dead. Castor tells the team of scientist and government officials to search the skies for the satellite, buying the crew in space more time to deploy the now-intert Sputnik.


Sunrise! USSR picks up the trajectory of Sputnik, and confirms that the satellite is still in orbit, but no signal.  It must be that the battery is exhausted.


The news reports capture all the scenes of the Sputnik re-launch so the ASTRO team has to devise a cover story- the B-Movie “Terror from Outer Space!” fiming at the Star View Drive in.

The Cover-Up: TERROR FROM OUTER SPACE movies
TFOR is a HUGE hit - think Star Trek, AND 2001, AND Star Trek combined from the 1950s into the future.
The series of movies:
Fellow Traveler
Lina on Venus
Rocket (Launch) to Mars
Earth Defends
Star View 2057










Star View Story Line Ideas:
“Star View” = universe


“The night with two moons” = Adventure to avoid the atomic earth war


“Terror from outer space” = cover up film 


The antagonists are best suited to be an already warring alien battle that is directed to Earth because BOB the B.L.O.B is the fan who lionizes the Earth Science Fiction Heroes


The Multi track story is as follows:


Star View is the universe where the full novelization and exact scripted dialogue and full detail can be written about the ‘real story’ of what happened to save the Earth from the Atomic Earth War.  


The Night with two moons is a short introductory story to the real story of star view, the first invasion Earth destabilizing attack from the council, foiled by the Star View Astro team and the reveal of Bob the Blob in the real story.


Space War One 
Cold war via propaganda films beamed into the interstellar cosmos from the Star View Drive In Theater.  We trick the invaders into calling off their attack, and have to keep the charade up, a cover up and a bluff that WORKS!


TFOS is the script and the B-Movie filmed to cover up and bluff the alien invaders.


Fellow Traveler is the cold war era analogue that Castor and Pollux represent in the USA and the USSR.  This echoes through into the Cold Space War B-Movies projected into the ether.


Lina on Venus is the storyline that is the Star turn for Lina, another B-movie that is to misdirect invasion force to venus, incinerating them!


Story One:
Intro/Sputnik Lina zappedSignals starview & Joe Pollux Fight Saucer Launch Space flight Lina escapes robot humanoid monster Overhears alien bad actor on council

Star View Storytelling
Testing 123 dictation iPad Starview test Monday, October 9, 2023, 9:58 PM
Jessi I’m a tell you about this new story idea for Starview 
I’m pretty excited about it this is recording really nicely with this fire stuff down of general idea is to add more intrigue to the story


It will land by flying directly over the observatory and land in the caves of branson caves that was an idea of always had. 


that idea is that pollex the alien spacecraft pilot is part of a set of twins- Castor and in Pollux. 


One goes to the allies: pollux joins the operation papoerclip team working to retrofit and extend the V-2 rockat program. 

castor goes to the USSR 


Pollux goes to the United States and I’m looking for historical moments that would either be conspiracies at the same exact time in the Soviet history of real life at the same time valve Los Angeles 


I still am trying to figure out where exactly Joe and Lina are like when they’re born what they see as little children in the maybe 30s but probably 40s and of course you know me it is Wike always Rocketeer best to the idea in my like 40s erais that 


Pollux is intentionally there as a scout guide type of character not there to fight but there to kind of guide and hopefully be of assistance to like keep earth safe 


it’s kind of the idea and I don’t know if that’s keep Earth safe from itself or from space or keep Stacy from earth who like really really love the idea of having to be like yup humans are the danger because we are the danger 


the ideas that Catherine politics are embedded in each of the two superpowers of the car 


and if they’re in Bethany to the supervisor the cold war and then you take the real history of human space flight and you see that Russia did sputnik first and 
Russia did man space first 
what would’ve caused caster to cause Russia to be ahead in the space race 


Star View Storytelling:  San Francisco, October 2022


 testing 123 testing to see if saying things about Starview fast and normal will record into Google Docs things to the computer that doesn’t all have to be in Russian 


Testing 123 testing 378 a different pick that up testing for Starview Jo Lina bob the blob I creature Roswell Starview test test test


Testing 123 Starview what happens if I’m going to mail a minute and talking really fast to get excited about this idea testing I got everybody but one of those words


Yes I can use it today Jessi Jordan on our anniversary trip 
“I am going to tell you the story of Starview”
I am going to tell you the story of Starview as a whole list today as we flew over Roswell New Mexico on our way to San Francisco from Austin Texas 


Cool. 
By the way I’ve been working on Starview for over 10 years and one of the inspirations that I have drawn heavily from is Mars attacks and as I was doing a quick little bit of writing on the flight I looked at the speed of the story of Mars attacks and was inspired to wrap how much action happens instantly if you look at the story of Mars attacks…


OK I will tell you what I believe is the kind of sequence of the story beats 




________________
Started with Sputnik
My idea has always started with Sputnik and so the story happens between October 4th and January 1957 through the very very tiny start at 58 and probably around this time maybe a little bit later than now because right now this is the first week of October maybe after Halloween not sure exactly when to the day is set but it opens in a very very very calm way. 


I love you so much! <3 - Jessi 6-22-2020


thank you for listening

“Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom
Life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you to a paradise up above
If you will tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
Life could be a dream
If only all my precious plans would come true
If you would let me spend my whole life loving you
Life could be a dream, sweetheart (Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom)
Every time I look at you
Something is on my mind
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we could be so fine
Oh, life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you to a paradise up above
Sh-boom, and tell me, darling, I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again
Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom
Oh, life could be a dream
Life could be a dream, sweetheart”






________________
Flashbacks


After the battle of Los Angeles… The first arrival was in 1946 in New Mexico.
________________
Back East
So they finally figure out that they can like connect the back have together which will be really fascinating and that might be a really interesting week relationship and log as well because I’m thinking more and more about having Joe be the the Back East child of an MIT family 


part of the Oppenheimer group so like I think Joe’s gonna be like 
“I was there when Daft Punk was playing in my basement” he was like: 
“I was there and he might see you when we first did the first piles.” 

“I was there with the Hindenburg was in Boston.” 
I was there because the more I look at it there’s joyful adventures all the way from the 30s tell now and if my story is going to be set for 1957 in October until 1961 when Eisenhower gives a speech about the military industrial complex and leaves that’s my window. 

I need to cover almost everything up to and including that and it’s going to kind of be that this is the story of how flash Gordon was an idea and then it turned to special future instead which is not as exciting as of this is like a retelling of how you can have that golden era of Syfy maybe go forward or maybe just a weaving of the golden era crazy and then in that 10 years Joe could literally be there for Trinity in 45 as like a nine-year-old and then 10 years later he’s back east or something like that and then comes back is kind of a new person, but was still in elementary school age or younger almost like Muppet babies with Lina. I think it’s a really cool like childhood friend then have this massive venture grow into a relationship situation because I think they’re archetypal in that way and the whole idea is to like how do you set it up to be like this agency is going to just basically you’re gonna go off and have monsters of the week 50s and 60s style away from human history was pretty excited about that. I think you’re listening.

 If Joe and Lina are tiny children would they be able to get into the gas the observatory could they open the planetarium would they know where the power switches are and that’s what is it

SILO MOVIE SCENE:
in the original sequence Joe has jumped onto the rocket and is climbing and hanging on the side of the Redstone rocket in really cool angles of sequence and very Indiana Jones as action there’s a countdown happening there’s a little bit of smoke and steam happening because it’s straight up in a rocket launch countdown goes down and Joe’s hanging on wearing his shirt and tie not even his hanging on timer that the timer countdown goes to zero and then the elevator sucks lifting the rocket instead of the launch from inside the tube so it’s like still hanging on the side of the rocket at that point in time. 
Pollux is the astronaut name X – 15 saves Joe and pulls him into either the capsule or the saucer portion of this rocket so that he can survive and launch with

The shed tucked between the legs of the screen behind the Star View Drive-In was cramped owing to the fact that there was a giant flying saucer wedged inside. 


The flying disc Hastily stowed diagonally inside, and it succeeded in filling the entire space. On his work desk Joe was tinkering with his latest radio signal device. next to his Underwood typewriter was a stack of schematics that described his efforts to turn his obsolete beaker Drive-In speaker into a radio Ray machine transmitter.
 he leaned forward on the red stool and rested his feet at the bottom of his work desk Shelf jazz music played in the small transistor radio and the one bulb at the side of his shed cast Long Shadows across the movie posters newspaper clippings Lobby cards Pulp Fiction magazines and pin-up girls that filled his bulletin board wall.


An eight legged creature with two wildly waving arms light blue in color with a giraffe like neck protruding from the center of the Torso craned it's giant globular eyeball around the corner. the blue eye alien could command every lever of the machine. Joe was glad to have an additional operator of the projection booth at the star view even if his staff member was out of this world. come on blue we have to keep the film rolling I need the next reel.


 without a second hesitation the blue creature zipped one of it's lower arms across to the film canister and opened the holder for the third reel.

REELONESEQUENCE1=INTRODUCTIONSA1. 
Reel One: Drive In




Introduce Lina
“Thank you for visiting the Griffith Observatory planetarium.” Lina’s show-stopping voice rang out into the darkness.


The house lights faded in, filling the dome with a light blue glow.


Lina closed the planetarium door, shooing away two hyperactive schoolchildren who eagerly crowded in to see the bright blue ceiling that seemed to reach upward forever  in auditorium within.


“Come on now, run along back to the group!”
“You don’t want to get lost here in the Observatory.”


The Obserbatory’s Planetarium projector groaned as it rotated on a central axis. With a click, the entire night sky lit the blow hemisphere with tiny points of light. Another click, and an encyclopedia of constellation lines overlayed onto the brightest stars showing the patterns that have inspired our planet’s star watchers throughout time.


The head of the projector was a black globe dotted with lights shining through lenses and specialized filters. 


The rotation halted and shifted direction when Lina pressed a button to bring the projector into storage configuration. A brilliant band of stars lit from a series of new lenses, and shined the entire galaxy’s white bands of teeming stars onto the sparkling display!


Seeing that the main armature had reached it’s main support structure, Lina gathered the maintenance kit, and pressed a few switches on the control board. 


Satisfied that the projector was powered off, She walked over toward the large projector and stepped through the rows of chairs to the base of the platform lift. 






Lina set to work that would keep the heart of the observatory ship-shape.  


“There you go.” Lina said to the projector. “Let’s get you stowed safe and sound.”


The Zeiss projector folded and whirred as it settled into place for the night. 
She gently brushed the lensed sphere, and inspected the connector housings with her pointing wand.  This specialized flashlight pointed a bright indicator into the stars in her show, and also gave a brilliant inspection tool when used up close to confirm that each unique lens was in top condition.








Autumn in LA
The sunset brought darkness early in the park, and Lina had to make up time.  Joe would already be popping the popcorn, and he probably would burn it.


Lina had to hurry. She pulled out into the street near the parking lot of the observatory.


The setting sun sun blazed a bright orange and the bright dot nearly touched the Hollywood sign. The hazy dusk of the cityscape to the east was fading into a set of high clouds that caught the rays of the day’s end. 


The glow of the sunset filled the sky from the west with incandescent fire-orange. The sky seemed to glow brighter than   The Park’s light fixtures clicked on their bright shine, mixing a soft glow onto the streets as the orange overhead darkened into crimson in the sky.


She weaved the car around the city bus idling outside the stoop, and sent her car into an accelerated move onward toward Mount Hollywood.


Describe the Plymouth


The Plymouth was shiny but nearing a decade of use. 
Lena Robinson maneuvered the car deftly along the curve leading to the drive-in’s ticket booth. As she craned her neck to see out toward her upcoming turn’s path, her blonde curly hair caught the setting sun for an instant, igniting a shining yellow spark contrasted brightly against the dark maroon and grey of the Plymouth’s interior.




Lina Tromped the clutch with her left foot and tugged the gearshift. The shifyer was capped with an off-white cap that would have showed her gear position if she looked down.  Lina scantly had to look, as she maneuver the  car deftly 


he steering wheel held a chrome armature Joed had installed for her. Just below the horn and logo bar at the center of the wheel sat a si=rive in movie speaker, modified to contain an additional set of electronics. It had a extra button, and a socket for the cord connected the radio to power.  A die-cast circle flourish at the center had been installed by hand, and a tiny light lit up inside. When the Plymouth crossed into the Star View’s lot, the radio buzzed and crackled to life with sound.


The embossed words “Star View” proudly sang across the speaker’s grille. Below the metal logo a dial and small red signal button filled the recessed metal section. 


The Star View the speaker came from was Joe;s theater. 


Describe and introduce the Star View Drive In movie theater
The Star view drive in sat nestled inside a bend of Griffith Park.  The clearing was used in the great wildfire.


Introduce Joe
Joe Nelson looked out across the lot and saw a black Plymouth driving toward his outpost.




Lina pulled up to the theater’s projection shack.


Introduce Pollux
Alex is an astronaut from another galaxy Gemini sector. The twin clones canister and Alex arrived to earth after again after atomic age again. 


His light gray skin and thin mouth were all that was visible under the laboratory lights. His bald domed head shined a soft reflection that almost appeared blue under the bright bulbs as he removed  his hat.


His eyes were two giant black orbs, gleaming and striking with a furrowed brow on an elongated forehead. No pupils filled pollux’s eyes, and a crystalline structure resolved  under the clear glassy film of the the alien’s eye whenever light would trace across his face.  Pollux was a Gemini scout, sent to Earth by the council. His was a mission to support the uneasy balance protecting the galaxy from Earth’s new and still developing threat.


Describe the Saucer
The flying disc was perfectly reflective chrome. A half sphere dome sat atop the sharp circle and it protruded above the slope thay curved upward from the saucer’s edge.  


The saucer hung in flight as though suspended by wire from an enourmous invisible armature.  It flew almost silently, with only a slight sound of a whoosh as it slipped through the air. The noise reverberated in a way that was indistinguishable from a breeze, or the thwhip of a Theon baseball spinning through the sky.


How it could maneuver!  The ship arced and swooped the most vivid lines of transit un the sky.


Jets of vaopr, a spinning disc area, magnetic repel technoloht, thust firactional directed maneuvers, etc.


 The sauce or may not have belongs to Holics initially, but he maneuvered it like it was the craft he had flown his entire life


Three landing struts descended from the core underside of the ship. The thin claws that extended toward the landing platform barely looked like they could support the craft’s size.  


“Dvorak-symphonicvariations”


A hatch opened on the underside of the front slope.  A stairwell ramp appeared and lowered to the hanger floor. 


A silver boot stepped down and an astronaut in a silver flight suit emerged from the saucer.  His white Helmet reflected and skewed in the reflections that played under the shaded curve of the disc. 


Checking a few ports, the astronaut readied his craft for the next phase of his mission maission. 


A mission patch depicting a constellation on blue clung brightly on the shoulder of his suit. The patch was located in the shoulder spot that usually housed the flag, bringing an unknown oeigin to mind.


 


Describe the Astro Base
Alex walked into the tunnels that lead from the flight hanger bay. Across hey metal gantry, . The astronaut crossed into a mechanical control station


Describe the Tunnels
A network of doorways fill a tunnel network reaching deep into the mountains of Griffith park.  The rock tunnels arppeared to be hastily hewn within this deepest hidden section of the quarry, and the structures were supported at a regular interval by metal archways of light silver honeycomb cast with hollow structural voids.


The archways supported a light fixture connected to a series of power and communication lines that snaked across the center of the tunnel’s roof.








Describe Bronson Canyon Cave
Bronson Cave was silent,  The craggy mouth was deserted as Lina and Joe approached the opending.  


Describe the splendor of the Griffith Observatory


Nighttime Los Angleles when overlooked from the observatory.
The city of lights stretched out toward the Verizon. Mines brightness crisscrossed the grid in the squares of city extend outward from Griffith Park  until the eye could no longer distinguish them


The atmosphere in the twinkle of lights pattern look almost like a sparkling organism thrown across the more canyon


LO outshined the stars in the sky. A fitting reflection of the home of the movies. Hollywoodland  a joined Griffith Park and at the observatory the public was always welcomed.


Feds at the Worthington Art deco tower at La Brea. 
Clem Wilson building as a gothic tower radio outpost for the Feds.
La brea tar pits is just down the block from the Feds!




Introduce Linas dad the general


General Robinson was a no-nonsense leader. His steady determination kept the military precision of the installation going.










R1-A1 - Star View at Griffith Park
B-1. Chapter One Star View - Science Fiction Double Feature
B-2 Joe Stationed at the Star View
Joe was stationed for the star view outpost. 
Joe walked to the monitor and could not believe what he saw.  


Perhaps It’s a secret entrance to the ASTRO lab?


The blinking line of green dots showed the situation perfectly.  Each spot of green that flashed on the screen showed a radar-sourced location of an inbound automobile. Tonight looked like it would be a sell out!


At Star View the movie “Terror from Outer Space” is playing at the drive-in theater and we see scenes of terror from outer space which recycles V2 rocket footage as a cheesy rocket


The film is schlocky and z-grade to fill the end of a double triple or even quadruple bill at the drive in.


Terror From Outer Space recycles literal hubcaps and other incredibly cheesy things for science fiction and there might be like exclamations of “I can see the zipper on a monster!” 
The aline villain might be a monster that is a super, super, super, cheesy one that could then be reflected as a real creature later on in the story. This foe foreshadows the destructors, and their Earth Threat Attackers.


The “Terror from Outer Space” sequence doesn’t have much story beat to it. The tone of the film  just sets the table that you’re at Star View. It also shows the level of the cheesy films that are the same type and structure as the cover up film!
R1-B1 - Sputnik at Star View Interrupted
A-2 Launch of Sputnik


Sputnik is orbiting and it is all in and beeping and that’s nothing unusual about that. 
After you see Sputnik we immediately arrive at the Star View Drive In Theater which is north of Los Angeles in the Hollywood Hills nestled at the fire break trailhead area of Griffith just down the mountain from Griffith Observatory, and situated up and over the hill from Bronson Canyon.
R1-C1 - The Attack of the Brain Creature From Outer Space
B-3 In October 1957, Sputnik I interrupts the movie (and Lina and Joe's date) at the Star-Vu Drive In the fall evening of October 4th…


The movie is interrupted 


it’s interrupted by the star the star view theater system being interrupted by the BEEP beep beep pattern signal noise of Sputnik 


Joe is introduced being frustrated at the Russians for interrupting his movie experience because he has crafted an early early handheld transistor radio stereo system sound and it just so happens to use the frequency that Sputnik uses as his radio transmitter that’s the happenstance that connects Starview in Spanish and he speaks in a way that it’s like literally every orbit during the night it ruins that section of his audio show. Most nights Joe is the sole worker at the drive-in, running the projector, the sound system, the concession stand, and he’s the manager! 


Lina is there with him at the start of you and so she also knows that it is always happening 


“Attack of the Brain” “with magical mind powers”


The silver sunlit sphere faded as it sped out of orbit range. 


Sputnik continues this particular night it beeps and that sort of thing and we may see that in the first feature and then the second feature may start without being shown it might be implied that there at the second picture of the double feature which allows it to be the Rocky horror science fiction double feature tonight. 


Three minutes of beeping every 90 minutes is the interference from Sputnik on the Star view’s home built 3D stereo dimensional sound.


Joe had cobbled the sound system together giving each car a special effect box and the ability to hear a stereo rendition, including foley, additional soundtracks, etc.


Star View 3D sound brought in the customers, but Joe was still unsatisfied with his effort. “It sure isn’t the technological marvel that it could be!”
 
The idea of a specific experience for the audio of these moves may be long gone, but they show the b-movies inspiration.
Mmmmmmk
R1-D1 - Lousy Red Moon! 90 minutes Later - Radio system interrupted
Cold War Atomic Age
Man just launched our first satellite…


Sputnik!


Oh God, they’re really doing it.


“Beep”
“Beep” 
“BEEP”
“BEEP”
“BEEP!”


Radio waves emanated from Sputnik.








At the star view, we arrive to see the marquee and flashing lights of the neon sign. Now showing: Terror from outer space!  The Drive in movie crackles with bright silver screen science fiction.  Cars are filling the drive in, and the projection booth nestled atop the concession stand flickers the image onto the screen across the lot. 


A man in a suit and lab coat talks down to a buxom blonde lab assistant, telling her to get ready to depart.  (Shades of Iron Giant brain movie) She’s dressed in a form-fitting white full-length lab coat and has librarian glasses.




Joe and Lina, huddled in the front seat of the Plymouth as the science fiction film unspooled. 


 Joe checked his watch.  
“Uh-oh.” Joe said. “Any second now…”


A brain creature gloms onto the head of the square-chinned laboratory man and an anguished cry rings out: “Aughh!” 
“Auuug-BEEP!” The movie dialogue mixes with the noise of the Soviet satellite. 
“BEEP!” 
“BEEP!”




Sputnik’s radio transmission disrupted the Star View audio system.


Sputnik spun a line directly overhead, like a comet, a tiny dot arcing from beyond the radio tower and the projection booth into a direct line ending when the artificial moon settles behind the screen just above the swingset in front of the Star View screen.


“Lousy Reds.” Joe smacked the Drive In speaker next to him.  “Using my frequency… of all the wavelengths they had to pick mine!”




BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!


“HONK HONK HONK!”
“C’mon, it’s messed up!”
“Hey bud, the movie sound isn’t working.”


“I Know! It’s Sputnik, give me a minute.!”


“Like fun it’s Sputnik.  I want a refund!”


“Sigh.”Joe couldn’t believe it. “They weren’t complaining when I rigged this stereo sound Setup, but now-“


“BEEP!” 
“BEEP!” 
“BEEP!”
Sputnik reached the apex of starlit sky above the Star View theater.


Static crunched across the Star View lot speaker system and the brain slithered away from the Blonde on the screen.


The B-movie vixen played up her villainous turn on the screen, holding the leashes of three brains on chains slithering in front of her. 


She’s the lab assistant, and she slowly unbuttons her lab coatto unveil a slinky little dress resplendent with little tech gadgets and tubes along the sides.


She enters the antechamber of the lab, with painted stones lining the wall. She barks an aggressive challenge, but her words tumbled out garbled in the static mix of the satellite’s transmission.  Sputnik intermingled with the soundtrack of her speech into a mess of scratchy tones mixed with beeps and static.


“BEEPpuny!” The femme fatale crowed at the hapless victim.
“Beepskrishhsimple! Beepmanskrsshh!”


“Honk!” 
“Hey!  The Sound is broken!” 
“Honk!”


“Beep!” Sputnik’s tones filled the theater’s lot. “Beep!” 
“Beep…”


“Okay it should work now, turn up your speakers!” Joe shouted.


“Darn Sputnik.”


Smack!  
Joe hit the radio transmitter.  A sizzle sounded and waves rang out from his radio tower. 


The radio tower reached fifty feet above the canyon floor, bounded by the pine trees at the edge of the clearing in the Hollywood hills.
C1 Space Chase and Sputnik Encounter


so you go back to Sputnik and immediately a green sphere pushes past the camera and slams into Sputnik and enveloped it completely 


The antenna arms are sticking outside of this sphere of green translucent gel.  


Sputnik sits in microgravity in orbit, so the green slime is a clean sphere layered around the Soviet moon. There is a small blurb-let of green sticking down the antenna lines.  


we see the reason for the frantic speed of the green sphere.  


It’s being chased by a ferocious giant eyeball with tentacles for a body underneath the eye. The eye flies through space, chasing the green blob.


Directly in the middle of the tentacles of like six arms is a razor-sharp mess of things as a mouth directly in the base. 
This eye creature can walk on its mouth as it slithers so this thing hurtles past. 


As soon as it hurdles pass you see those eyeballs like emote that it’s sneaking away because being chased by this giant ice preacher


Do you see the little bit of ooze start to kind of reach out like it’s an arm and kind of in a position where I look like an arm for size and then it makes a water droplet effect and you see that I start to panic is that he does not want to have that arm extends feel like alert the iron creature that is just gone by and the little piece of news goes bloop! and floats in the space next to Sputnik which the eye creature sees because it’s means I around like the ISR on and it just freaks out spins around and just comes right after Sputnik -which is this green blob at this point in time - 


with eyes at which time the green who’s ball and so they are immediately screaming down toward Southern California lights flashing bright laser green color astroid looking thing like a meteorite that’s the bright green variety that you’ve seen perhaps and following right behind it is the crazy eye creature right in the eye creature gets flame reentry flying on top of like it’s surface and it might there might be some sort of interesting like alien science words it’s capsule is tears or something right there’s no actual space ship for this I creatures of the floating eyeball monster and the other is its own thing it’s a spaceship they can protect Sputnik so they’re barreling towards Southern California because this is happening there on the western hemisphere 


it’s out of direct line of site with the USSR so unless they actually had radio listener station to say probably dead but who knows what will assume that it would take a little bit of word of mouth to say suddenly up any longer and if that trigger happens 


because sure enough Sputnik is the opening right now so you see the news covered Sputnik screaming towards earth following behind immediately is this a creature comet of like red orange and yellow fire with the eye creature inside of that perfectly fine without any trouble because the alien monsters can do that sort of magic.
R1-E1 - Radio trower climb During the Trailer at intermission?
D Interrupts the Film at The Star View
Cut back to Star View Joe has had the movie interrupted again his Sputnik is there above Star View except this time it didn’t stop it’s still beeping and it’s and the cars are honking in time with the Sputnik because people are unhappy because the only draw for this rickety old Starview drive-in theaters that they’re in super radio sound because they could go anywhere else in Hollywood but his radio sound is the big draw and so they’re paying customers are flipping out because he can’t hear the movie.

Which is kind of a joke in itself because you know the second of a double feature movie so because Sputnik keeps beeping on those radio waves that are sent out from the drive-in theater radio tower which is connected to the concession stand is where Joe’s radio room is and it’s basically just a platform there and maybe an umbrella or something for whatever the weather gives them as he’s up there and it keeps beeping and the crowd is impatient and

The green one gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until a beach ball of translucent glowing luminous glow in the dark green laser green surrounding Sputnik whizzes past Joe. 


It buzzes nearby so close that he leans over the railing looking at it just completely he can’t believe it and immediately following the same reentry course is a flaming eyeball that nearly knocked him off the tower. 


They arrive in swift immediate succession like an amazing action sequence the entire drive-in theater is erupting into a panic because two giant things of comets have just literally landed without any explosion, whooshing fireballs eclipsing the brightness of the film.
R1-F1 - Sha-boom crash the sputnik and Eye crash into the clearing, destroying the theater screen
E2 The Objects Smash into the drive in screen.
The Objects Smash into the drive-in screen.


“Sh-Boom!”
The falling objects blasted into view, and smashed the theater screen in half!


The objects swerve to the right after blasting through the movie screen.  Hooking toward Fern Dell, the  eyeball creature ringed in flame is blasting and chasing the globular green sphere at unearthly speeds, knocking dual sonic booms in the canyon to the west.


The screen’s debris tumbles to the parking lot.

There is honking! There is running! All the theatergoers are screaming and Joe looks up and the entire theater screen is cut in half with glowing green in Fire spewing in the split screen 


in physical geography from Griffith Observatory entry angle through the screen into Bronson canyon.


The theater crowd panicke
 
“That’s it for the night.” 


Cars honked, and fender benders abound as people swerve and try to flee the scene. Joe gets on the radio and tries to calm the crowd,
 
“Don’t Panic!” Joe implored the frenzied crowd. “It’s all part of the show!”

E4 Cops arrive and start investigating the Star View
Cops arrive because reports of the explosion at the Star View are called in.  The Hollywoodland cops are crawling the grounds of the Star View.


we cut to Joe and Lina trying to make sense of what to do Lina is a very supportive partner to Joe.


Joe is the single proprietor of this place and there may be stuff wrapped into that. 


like it may be a legacy of his or something or whatever he’s getting a little consolation but the whole time Sputnik keeps beeping and when Lina comes in to talk to him because he’s totally like 
“my Theater is destroyed “


The ooze news escaping the Eye creature brings sputnik to rest in the caves of Griffith Park. 
In the pandemonium of the screening at the Starview drive-in theater Joe and Lina slip away because their radio receiver picks up Sputnik’s signal - it was nearby! 




R2-B1 - Radio Signal Receiver - still going!  Sputnik must still be here in Griffith Park!
Lina brought one of the wireless radio receivers into the radio room where the two have retreated from the frenzy of activity.  
As she brought one in, the wireless radio receiver buzzes differently
they realize that the signal triangulates and that they then 


“Hold on! Hold on!” Joe exclaimed as he ran to Lina. “Step back three steps.“


Joe adjusted a dial on his workshop’s radio workbench. 


The radio changed pitch and then volume and so it confirms what Joe kind of thought because he could hear it the volume changes louder and louder as it approached from space and he was in the mode of not getting hit by these two meteorites and so he’s finally put it together that they can try and go out to see what happened and they also know where it was so they gotta go investigate.
R2-C1 - Press follows the Plymouth


Headlights off, the press follows the Plymouth through the winding streets of Hollywoodland as Joe and Lina drive toward the canyon to investigate.
H1Chapter3. Investigating BRONSON CAVE
K2 Turning on the Radio Reciever
Joe turns on his radio receiver and the clearest tones register without pause:

“Beep!”
“Beep!”
“Beep!”
“Beep!”
“Beep!”
“Beep!”


Investigating the cave


   * Joe and Lina bring the Plymouth to the Bronson Cave entrance


   *    * Joe picks up a piece of the ooze and Places it into his radio
   * 





The plymouth roared to life as Joe pushed the ignition button.  Lina shoved him out of the way.
:not so fast, mister.’
I’m driving us there, I know the fastest route to the canyon.  




The dark streets of Hollywoodland leading to Bronson Canyon led them toward the tone repeating in the radio receiver.


The Plymouth passed 

   * Explore the cave, looking for Sputnik


“Careful, Joe,” Lina urged, “we don’t know what we will discover in the cave.”


She stared into the Cave.  Something seemed different about the opening.  A different angle of light from inside?  The freshly disturbed rocks strewn about the entrance told the tale of a cosmic arrival.  


Lina lit the beam of her flashlight.  The small circle of light shined brightly in the darkness, illuminating the dusty rocks on the cave floor. A gouge tore a rough like in the floor of the cave. It ran from just before the entrance, and continued until it disappeared inside the tunnel’s darkness within the cave. 


Exploring the abandoned cave they find a perfectly intact sputnik hidden inside the cavern. 






   * Pebbles, stones, and small boulders were displaced and furrowed into a trail from a terrific force.
________________
   * 
   * A new branch of the cave is opened!
   * Sputnik covered in green ooze


R2-D1 - Exploring the Cave
Sputnik crashed into the Cave


they see Sputnik there on the ground like an Indiana Jones McGuffin.  


The crash path is cleared just like the little baby Cal El Superman’s ship has landed to that same pattern of dirt as for the ground in Kansas.  It’s literally the Bronson cave from back in the Batcave and that sort of thing!


When we went with Andy Junior’s photos who were there so we can know exactly what it looks like to draw it out. 


it’s gonna be amazing it’s covered in the green slime and you can see that passed it there’s a cylinder that has been bored through probably 20 feet wide which is what it really isn’t it in the physical place by that I went to. 


Lina takes off and heads to the cave - Joe saw it and he’s chasing after Lina.


“You can’t go in there without me!”
“Oh yeah, Watch me!”
“...because the green comet had sort of an eyeball monster chasing it!  




________________
they go investigate and they see things on green and orange fire all sorts of stuff all the way through directly to the cave and they know the cave because at that point in time in the 50s this cave is already famous for movie use


An interesting idea to explore if that Caveland was part of Lina’s family or something like that so maybe they have some sort of rights there and that plays into the fact that they drive to the Cave.


They see that the trajectory takes it directly into the cave opening and Leo just wants to go for and Joe has no idea what’s going on but they know that the Sputnik noises like ultra right there and that makes them think that Sputnik is crashed there which would be obvious that they can’t believe it’s still beeping they argue a little bit about the plan.

      * Footsteps sound in the distance- Joe and Lina hide!

you can’t just go in you don’t know what is that thing right because at this point in time no one has actually seen a photograph of Sputnik in the West. 


They functionally do not know it’s so as they go in the cave. 




Bronson Canyon Cave
         * Empty!  Radio crackles

R2-E1 - This must be Sputnik!
K3. This Must Be Sputnik!
back to Sputnik and Joe and Lina are discussing what do they do 
“This must be Sputnik,” Lina exclaimed, crouching down to th e silver form. “What’s all this green stuff right here?”
“This is the reason for the commotion tonight.”
they’ve never seen this must be It 




So they go and they see Sputnik and they’re trying to keep their distance because it’s glowing green it sounds like the danger… 



R2-F1 - Ooze on their Shoes
Footsteps approaching!
Right they then hear footsteps approaching in the gravel because it’s this old gravel pit that has this tunnel cave and so they’re trying to hide in here walks in a guy in a space suit.


A full-on mercury style pre-mercury by about 5 to 7 years flight suit full on helmet on probably chrome helmet and probably silver suit but maybe black I’m not certain yet 


so they they literally say something or some thing because they see this glowing orb of shoes which is now not blob and as soon as this new individual arrives they’re trying to hide but there’s no place to go to board there’s no hiding spots and then as soon as that astronaut looking guy arrives 


just before they get ready to say something the astronaut is like 
“stand back” in English word must be an American astronaut is the idea and so they they just pretty much freeze 


         * X-15 joins the fight
         * “Stand Back, Humans!” they hide in the corridor

Exploring the tunnels Joe encounters the general and he tries to explain the situation.


Joe is escorted away.




Warehouse and the Saucer


Lina hides among the boxes of the warehouse as she hears Joe get taken away.
When Lina peers under the tarp she sees a shiny metal surface. In the reflections of the gleaming metal she can perfectly watch what transpires in the hallway. 


Wandering the tunnels
Wandering the tunnels Joe and Lina encounter the empty passageways soon discover the control panel hewn roughly in from the rocky wall…


There just is a control panel that was recessed in the rock wall


“I can’t find how to operate it.” She said. 
“Look for a switch” He replied. 
She looked around and found nothing.


Scrambling, she grabs one of the rocks from the tunnel’s floor and smashes the panel. 
With a terrific “KERRRANG!” she hits the panel and opens the access door.


Behind the door is the dusty confines of a storage warehouse. 
R3-E1 - Warehouse discovery - “Joe… Look!” Lina exclaimed. “It’s the flying saucer!”
         * Opening the access hatch - discover THE WAREHOUSE
         * See the saucer covered by tarps
         * “Joe! Lina shouted. “Look! It’s the saucer!”
The Abandoned Saucer
In the warehouse


They discovered THE SAUCER!


I really like that idea because this is the push comes to shove moment they are able to discover the saucer with the astronaut and they’re asking questions like I’m not gonna say anything about that she’s doing that right
J1. Tunnels to Area 19 - The LAB and Saucer hanger


The tunnels literally connect to Area 19 which is the scientific based installation area 51 style underneath the secret base and it just so happens in like that connected universe that’s very small way away. 


but Lina‘s dad is the general in charge of that installation and so there’s like the 1950s interplay 
When they finally get back to there with news about Sputnik or physically take it one of the two connects to that yes yes and 


so she might know more than she says when she says it’s salvage rights that it’s a possibility that she has a legal standing right so that’s that’s really interesting dynamic of this like in this world if Sputnik lands in this tunnel if it’s owned by Lina’s family concern.




Nestled at the center of the room among the wooden crates marked with serial numbers sits  a giant pile of tarps. It looked like a large round covered object.


Later as Lina reashes for the tarp to explore the familiar form. The dusty canvas slides across to reveal a silver ship she whistles softly. “Wow. She says… “it’s the saucer!

FLASHBACK CHAPTER R3-F1 - Battle of Los Angeles
F1Chapter2Flashback: “Battle of Los Angeles Pt. 1”


what if Joe and Lina as little children see the UFO that is the thing that issued out in the battle of Los Angeles


From Chat with Jessi, 2012: 
A small boy of seven or so years old plays at Griffith Observatory with a blonde girl he's never met before.
they have a bag of popcorn to share.
they play until the girls dad, the sarge assigned to the observatory, comes by and gruffly scoops her up and away.
you see, there's been some very strange blips on the advanced radar they have in the secret area under the observatory, where the boy's father works.
Joe’s dad (the father) and son don't go home that night, February 25, 1942 because of the high alert status the secret base has
Naturally, the boy sneaks away and falls asleep in the planetarium, bored out of his mind waiting for his dad to get done with work












at 2am, air sirens go off, and explosions fill the air of Los Angeles as a Flying Saucer hovers on a slow flight path over the Hollywood hills, surrounded by shells and flak from all sides
the little boy sneaks to the balcony because he can't believe he's seeing an ACTUAL flying saucer.
because of the noise he doesn't hear the little girl he met that afternoon scoot up next to him
this of course scares him, and he screams
she offers him some more popcorn, just like before.
the scream of a child bring the sarge and scientist running, as they were both dads with their kiddo in what they thought was the safest place in town- their secret science installation
after the Saucer disappears over the hills, they grab their respective kids, who never see each other again until 1959...
when Lina brings a bag of popcorn along when she meets Joe, who now works for the sarge guy his parent(s?) did


“Joe- I’m sure you remember my daughter, Angelina”
“How do you do-“
Seeing Lina for the first time in 17 years triggers a memory from their childhood together…


“How could I ever forget?”
“What?”
SPOTLIGHTS BLAST LIGHT INTO THE L.A. SKY
IT’S WORLD WAR II, AND EXPLOSIONS OF FLAK BURST OVER THE CITY OF ANGELS


“…Er…” “No One could ever forget childhood adventures running around the Observatory like that, sir!”
“Hrmpf.”“Very good.”


General 
“Lina, Let Joe show you to the gate.”




Whoa.
Hi Joe.


They had the run of the place! Lina and Joe run around Griffith Observatory late into the evening the night of the battle of Los Angeles. 


They sneak into a planetarium show and watch as the Zeiss projector displays a story of constellations outer space the night sky and comments and the idea of travel in the future into outer space 


They watch the electricity sparkle and lightning bolts crackle from the generator coil inside the room lined with metal cage walls. 


Explosions fill the sky of Los Angeles. It’s 3:00 A.M and the army batteries have been pouring rounds of ammunition aloft for the past hour. 


A slow moving flying saucer bright shiny silver descends through the billowing clouds.  All around the craft rumbles a pattern of gunpowder blasts that reverberate off the Hollywood Hills.  Along the western horizon, flashes that illuminate the air like subtle lightning reverberate in time with the anti-aircraft fire. The noise and rumble grows louder as the saucer approaches.
There is no way to sleep through the cacophony as war arrives to the United States mainland.


Lina opens her eyes and realizes the explosions are not just part of a drae, and the sequence of explosions is growing louder. 




F2 Quonset Bedroom
<Lina’s Chidlhood room>
Inside the furnished Quonset hut, Lina’s room looks like any regular bedroom, but half of the room is scooped away as though it is nestled in a tunnel.
Her father who works at the government office in Los Angeles‘s Griffith Park Observatory. A doting father, he has often explained to her what to do if she hears explosions.


“Yes, dad!” Lina exclaimed.         
“Find  yourself a route to our safe crawlspace 
and PLEASE stay put.“        
 “Yes, Dad!!” She repeated, exasperated.        


But this time the imagined danger is immediate and real. 






F3 Born to Explore
Lina was born to explore.




Now fully awake, the rhythm of explosions sounded like a dance playing on a radio in the distance to the little girl.
“I don’t know what those explosions are.“ She said matter-of-factly to her self. 
“But I wonder if I can see them from the tower on the roof quote.”


Pulling on a small jacket, she reached under her bunk and pulled out her slippers. Next to her shoes was a silver flashlight that she swiftly tucked into her right jacket pocket.
Ready to face the echoing darkness, she ventured out from her doorway into the kitchen.




F4 The observatory was closed in the evening, and the troops statined at the Outpost 


G Griffith Observatory
The observatory has been closed for hours the army has called a full blackout for all of Los Angeles. Lina can barely see her hand outstretched arms legs as she walks from the outpost dormitory to the main diocese of Griffin Observatory. Each alcove houses an exhibition presentation that is shrouded in muted tones of midnight blue. There is no auxiliary light is available with the blackout. The entire Southland’s radio network is silent. 


The television stations call signal into broadcasting test patterns long have been switched off by the station crews. 


Lina descends the small white stairs from the east wing’s display. Taking careful steps she hugs the wall to know exactly where she is because she has wondered if you observatory as many nights as she has stated. Each alcove represents a new piece of scientific learning that Lina has absorbed like the tables in the nursery rhymes of her recent stories


As Lina approaches the display that describes the rotation of the Earth she sees a darkened sphere no longer rotating. 


Ducking under the railing that separates the citizens and lecturers, she cuts through the wall section to save time. The gears of the moon earth system model are silent. The usual spotlight shines on the models the size of her head and tiny of the Earth system is dark, and the absence of the shine makes the total darkness seem even deeper..


Lina imagines a giant object has eclipse the entire site instead of the eclipse that the Earth and the moon give each other. 
“What if that is what we are shooting at?




“WHOA!”


The patterned roar of the artillery continues with its military cadence against the constant unrelenting secrets. 
Is it a weather balloon? 
Is it an enemy craft? 
Have the Japanese brought in incendiary war machine begin an attack on the city?


The soldiers don’t know anything at all.
“Fire!”
A fresh shell ejects from the gun in the battery bunkhouse.
Loading the next round, the soldiers can almost see the shine of the saucer with each explosions reflected on the surface of the disc.
  
Pearl Harbor is fresh in the headlines and at the top of their minds nothing slows the object… Its path does not waver… 


Each round of antiaircraft fire bursts another shell and another cloud obscures the object. 
Each squad’s earchlight is trained on the now fuzzy blob of a disc. 


The disc, a small silver object no bigger than a city bus moves out of range of one bank of searchlights and into  the next battle station pillar beams of weapon battery lights. 


The beams are constantly targeted on the craft, and the round clouds pf flak explosion obscured the object.


the rounds of explosions begin anew. Lean around another corner and then she sees a figure not much bigger than she…


From the shadows she hears “Lina?


 “Is that you? It’s three in the morning?”
“Joe!“ Lina began to breathe again as she recognized the shape of her little friend who also lived in the military dormitory in Griffith Park.


Joe Nelson wasn’t from Los Angeles. He knew this because he had seen so much traffic in so few years. His family was connected to so many scientific endeavors that he never had the opportunity to stay in the same school or class for more than a few semesters.


Is elementary school and middle school was a list of locations that would rival the strongest pedigree of a research scientist. Fitting for the son of two preeminent ones…


Lina knew that they weren’t allowed to explore overnight. This formality was never a problem before Lina’s father working his shift would often return moments after leaving.


Lina would often arrive from a night of study in the observatory minutes before her father returns from his shift Vicks. We never went to the outpost and her father never worried about where she would adventure.
The location that they always found themselves exploring what is the mystery of our star-filled night sky from the same modern marvel every single night. 


The telescope.




G2 Sneaking into to Dome




Lina looked across the rooftop terrace.  “Joe- there!” “Look!”




Inside the Telescope dome, the children sneak to the viewing stand and peered out into the pre-dawn inky black sky. 


Joe and Lina looked up as the Saucer, lit from a half dozen spotlights, silently glided downward to the valley.


They see the saucer is silver, and it flew below the edge of the dome, and crossied into the Bronson Canyon below the observatory walls.


Joe and Lina slipped past the door as they crept into the Dome atop the west wing of the Observatory. 
G3 Brazac Rescues the Children.
Emil Barzak, PHD. is a trusted friend and the unofficial guide and tutor for Joe and Lina. 


Hailed for his observations of the night sky is working hours necessitated his presence in the most intriguing of locations to curious scientifically minded children. His children had long grown up and left the city of angels to adventures back east almost mythical in stature. 




Having the duty of instruction and trust of a caretaker from both Lina and Joe’s families, Barzak began to teach them the observational and operational skills to be the lookouts and assistant telescope operators each evening as their parents attended to their duties. These scientific forays viewing the celestial wonders lasted into the evening until the children finally fell asleep and their parents would retrieve them for the night.


The massive telescope armature flickered in the night’s sharp staccato barrage with the pattern of flashing explosions. 


“Children!” Dr. Barzak half shouted. “You must come with me!”
He instructed them in a whisper so hushed it was almost silent. 


Thunderous explosions in the sky rained down the dust and bits of exploded masonry from target in altitude at the object of arrangement above Griffith Observatory. 


The doctor swooped them up into in his arms and rushed toward the instrument cabinet of shielded away from the dome’s open view port.










“Battle of Los Angeles Pt. 2”


They’re suddenly five years old again.
Joe has a radio, he picks up the UFO’s chatter after fiddling the antennae a bit.
Crackle static, tones, and a bit of garbled speaking. (It’s POLLUX {X-15})


“BZzzzZT.” Static filled a crackly, buzz, buzz, crackly noise from the receiver.
“U-F-O.” a garbled voice reacts.. “We are tracking.. Routed for intercept in T plus twenty-seven.”
“Crshhhht!” 
Whenever Joe moved the radio a fresh reverberation crackle of static obscures the dialogue.
“...Area One-Niner…”Replied another voice after a wave of audio static interrupts.
“Could it be a Balloon?”.
“Brzzzztt!” More static.
Inside the Observatory, the group recoiled with the report as each air burst of munition blasted in a futile attempt to bring down the unknown object. 


Through the open dome the children could see the foggy gray outlines of crawling searchlights.  


The light bounced off the gleaming surface of the craft that was drifting in the night sky. 
Each searchlight’s beam looked like tentacles of triangular prisms holding aloft this shiny shimmering silver disc. 


The craft is completely shrouded in the smoky hazy remnants of the early morning defense. It looms larger and continues silently hovering just above the Hollywood Hills. While it progresses through the achingly slow path


“Pshhhht” 
Joe adjusted the tuning once more.
“That’s a Negative on the balloon. It’s a real one….”
“Bzzt.”
“Location target: Griffith,” 
Atop Griffith Park, the splendid hollywood hills preserve north of the city, the Observatory made for the perfect vantage point for the ship’s arrival.
 “10-4, Roger.” 
“Beep.”
The static seemed to intentionally obscure the chatter. 
“Buzz”


Lina & Joe learn where the UFO base is - 


“Roger that, Hollywoodland.” The reply was slightly less garbled than before.
“Looks like the Observatory is the.. last triangulation… point used…”
“Observatory?” Lina said.“That’s us!”
Barzac motioned to the door. 
“It’s time to go now, children.” He said.
 “Come now, we must get to a more secure location.“ Dr. Barczak exclaimed. 


Silently working their way to the entrance of the telescope tower rotunda the three tiny figures opened the door and looked across the valley that housed the darkened metropolis below them… 


Beyond the terrace railings of the Observatory the shrouded city of Angels was not awash in light. 


A blackout order removed all but the straggling bits of light which were visible where the usual grid of the urban layout stretched its geometric pattern toward the infinity of the ocean. Tiny freckles of light still blinked in spots where the 

Joe turned the frequency dial the tiniest bit, and the radio tuned the reception a tiny bit clearer.
“I’m at Star View and I’ve got eyes on the bogey.” 
Lina turned to Joe with a look of sheer excitement and surprise.
“It’s in Griffith Park!” She whispered
“That ship is landing here!”


High above the Griffith Observatory, a saucer slowly tracks across the sky.
It floats only a few hundred feet above the domes, tracked by the spotlights on the lawn.  Flak blasts in the BG, far above and across the sky smokey blasts illuminate the sky like lightning flashes of war.


As they moved along the white stucco walls Lina looked over the sculptural art deco relief to see the craft continue evading the bombardment; it was only a few meters overhead now silent and shining.

Joe and Lina stare at each other unbelieving that they just saw a saucer land Lina immediately says Joe we’ve gotta go explore and see what happened to that saucer and what is that saucer and Joe immediately says no way will get in so much trouble there’s no chance that we can sneak out during a battle 


Asterix need to explored do the kids go find the saucer and investigate

Into the Observatory


In the planetarium, Barxac works to uncover the secret door to the shelter.
“Should I ask him if we should go look for the saucer?” Lina said to Joe in a low tone. 
“No!” Joe whispered. 
“Lina, Are you out of your mind?!”
“Come on, we gotta go see what happened!”
“Not a chance.” Joe said finally. 
“There are explosions everywhere! This is a war!”
“If it’s a part of the war, then why is the ship not shooting back?”

         * Lina sees an eye reflected in the metal of the saucer.
         * It’s an eye creature attack!
         * MPs burst into the warehouse chasing the eye creature
         * Eye creature attacks an mp, and Lina thwacks it with a long I-beam piece of metal (alien origin?) 
         * The couple is surrounded as the eye creature attacks and overpowers a guard and escapes.


Tunnels to ASTRO
Reel 4:
         * Scaring away the Eye Creature, Joe and Lina are found!
         * Surrounded and captured by the Military Police.
         * Searched and pockets cleared
         * Joe and Lina locked into library office room in tunnels
         * Lina taken to the general…
         * it’s her father, General Robinson!
         * Dad!  You didn’t tell me that you were stationed here in an underground complex!
         * The General is commanding the defense operation against the eye creature.








Lina absolutely establishes salvage rights and in a really fun and not glib but very forward way 


“this is this is ours we found it” 


we have the right somehow or other- I have the old family deeds that prove it.
and then there’s some banter of them 
“what are you talking about” Joe grumbled. “We can’t steal sputnik.”
“Not stealing- salvage!”
Do you have nay idea what happens if the Soviets figure out that it’s missing.  Or worse, that we SOTLE it?!
“it’s gotta go back into space or there’s gonna be a nuclear war!”


because in this storyline the idea is that as soon as the Sputnik beeps are not picked up over the USSR Cold War goes hot


OOZE leftover from the attack


 Lina’s father greets them and she cannot convince him of their discovery




Without believing them immediately the general agrees to go back to the site of the crash. 


When they arrive there’s nothing there in the dirt Canyon. 
Joe finds a piece of the green ooze.


Joe Picks it up, and secures it inside the radio receiver’s battery housing. He tucks it securely into his radio receiver's battery compartment. They’re taken back to the base. 


I have a connection that Has to happen there’s a bit of green OOZE that is left on either Sputnik itself or from the is it the news must hitch a ride from the area of Sputnik and it’s just a little tiny bit of green ooze and then there is likely that there’s going to be right in that 
















General Takes Lina to his office
He then takes Lina to the main control room to try to get to the bottom of this happened








Play this for the general exclaims. 
I thought you would be at the observatory? 
I’m always losing track of you.


“But dad, I’m a Sophomore at college.” 
“I know, and thats why I get to be worried about you.”


“A DATE!!”










General Argues with Lina
Joe and Lina are arrested and brought to the lab.  A kind of a traditional” if you come with me things will go easier for you.”  the feds or whatever that point rally and surround the couple and bring them through the tunnels to AREA 19. 
R4-A1 - Bronson Cave tunnels - captured!
Joe and Lina are arrested and brought to the lab.  A kind of a traditional” if you come with me things will go easier for you.”  the feds or whatever that point rally and surround the couple and bring them through the tunnels to AREA 19. 
R4-B1 - Meet Oop in holding cell
Lina and Joe captured and locked into the library room
Joe and Lina locked in the ASTRO Tunnels


After a round of questioning the general sends Joe to a holding room just a plain office room.  But next they are both locked in. Lina and Joe together locked up in the holding room.
They can both start to understand the Ooze is a key to the adventure.


Joe Locked into Library Room 
         * Joe interacts for the first time with the ooze
         * Oop!  Oop!  It echoes!
         * Oop grows in size
         * Joe tells Oop to go get the Key
         * Sneaks out to retrieve the key, returns as a grapefruit sized blob
         * Unlocks door, Joe and oop escape
         * RESCUE Lina from the general’s office…
         * Sneak back to Bronson Cave from Area 19
         * Find the Undisturbed Sputnik
He discovers the ooze responds to him!


OOZE Grows after eating popcorn


Joe set the blob of ooze onto the desk and watched as it responds to his voice. 


“It moves almost like it has intelligence…” Joe trailed off. 
The military police cleared his pockets, but in their haste they left behind a candy wrapper and a piece of popcorn. 
Joe picked the items up with a swoop and crushed the wrapper. Looking over to the locked door, Joe accidentally dropped the popcorn kernel onto the office floor. 
“Oop!”  
“Oop!” echoes a reply.


Tha’ts funny, Joe thinks.  
“Oop?” Joe says outloud.
“Oop!” The ooze clearly is audible this time.
“Opp.” Joe replied, dumbfounded. “Is that what I can call you?”
The green blob on the table wiggles and makes a blooping noise again.
“Oop!” the ooze said, excitedly. “Oop!”
“Wow, wait till Lina gets a load of this.”


Joe watched the Ooze as it tracked his hand’s motions on the table. 


Inspired, Joe picked up the popcorn and held it over to the blob. The ooze drew close to the little yellow puff like it was magnetized. Waving the popcorn from side to side, Joe watched the ooze burble into a stretched blob, at is reached out a bit of bubbly green slime toward the salty snack.


“Oop!” the small little blob cooed. “Oo-oop!”


Inspired, Joe flicked the buttered movie popcorn kernel into the air with his thumb and finger. 


The little ball of ooze leapt into the air! 
Before the popcorn landed on to the desk, Oop the ooze surrounded the popcorn with a giant midair gulp!


The ooze landed perfectly back on the desk, and Joe could already see the popcorn dissolving inside the translucent green creature.  


The green blob shimmered and wiggled with what looked like unmistakable joy! 
“Ooo-ooop!”
Inside of the blob, the popcorn floated and tiny flecks of shining green light formed on the edge of the feast. The atoms of the popcorn kernel fizzed and pop as they illuminated, disintegrated, and swiftly merged with the green form that enveloped the corn puff.


The metabolism from the tasty concession stand snack started the Ooze gowing. Fast!


The sudden catalyst of energy brought the Ooze growth rate to a massive speed.  It tripled in volume to the size of a baseball within a few seconds!


“Oop! Oop!” The instantly larger green blob now visibly mouthed the noises it made as it blooped across the table. “Oop!”






In the holding office Joe and the ooze begin to talk. 
“If I could only get my radio…” Joe thought out loud. “Then I could actually understand what you’re saying.”


Joe made gestures through movements you can understand him, and the ooze decides to take action.


Climbing the door, the ooze writhed its gelatenous form through the keyhole. As soon as it had started, it was gone. Silence filled the room that Joe was trapped within.


“Well, great.” Joe said dejectedly. “Now I’m really locked in all by myself.”


Minutes pass 


The Ooze tapped on the shoulder of a snoozing mission control worker, distracting and moving him to unveil the security key ring… 


and then suddenly he hears he has something rattles up the outside of the door


The handle turned. The key hole darkened as it is blocked by a dark green hue.  


The door swung ajar slightly and Joe opened it 
Stepping into the corridor, Joe looked around then down.. 
“The Radio!” Joe saw the green ooze standing on top of his radio holding a key. 
“Don't eat that.” Joe pointed at the key. “We might need it to get out of here.” 
The duo took off running in the direction he heard them take Lina.


The blob has grown to the size of a softball. 
“Did you find something to snack on?” Joe questioned the blob.  
Oop jumped aheadof joe’s stride to wiggle a bobbled yes!


“Great.” Joe muttered. “Another mouth to feed.” 
Joe smiled wryly as he looks down the corner of the tunnel.


“Come on.”
He quietly pressed against the wall frame partition. “They’ll be back any minute.” 


Joe peered through the round holes in the alloy struts that held the tunnel’s roof in place. The path ahead was deserted.  No motion and no obstacles to hide behind.


“Let’s go see if we can find Lina before they do.” He moved ahead cautiously. “We’re gonna need a lot of luck.
“Oop!” The ooze agreed, following it up by making an emphatic sound that only a green translucent organism could utter.






RESCUE LINA Joe and the Ooze rescue Lina from her dad’s Military office
Crisscrossing the tunnels, Joe and the OOZE find Lina. 


“Come on, Oop!” Joe motioned. “This looks like the control room.”
The room 
                                                                                                                                        
Seeking Lina
They escape with the help of the ooze and return to the Plymouth outside the mouth of the cave.


Lina gets Joe’s radio device back.
“Oop the Ooze on the Star View Radio Wave Receiver”
“Hello there, human!”


“Human?” he retorted. “Call me Joe.”
The three sneak across the catwalk and the hanger 
Sneaking out from the Tunnels






The three managed to sneak all the way back to the cave, finding that the Plymouth is still parked outside!


Not tonight mister, plymouth escape


WHOOSH!  
The saucer swooped in from above, stopping their escape in the Plymouth.


Out from the saucer stepped the same silver suited astronaut who joind the fracas in the tunnels earlier that evening.




R4-C1 - Escape and retrieve sputnik
Reel 6: Joe, Oop the Ooze, and Lina escape after being locked in the ASTRO Tunnels
         * Sneak through the tunnel complex back to the warehouse
         * Tracing their route back to the main cave…
         * Joe and Lina view and retrieve the uncovered sputnik
         * Picking it up, they place Sputnik in the back trunk hatch of the Plymouth and begin to drive down Bronson Canyon road.
         * X-15 swoops down with the saucer and blocks their escape in the Plymouth
         * You better come with me. Your father sent me to pick up you both and the satellite
         * Joe and Lina bring Sputnik to the team at AREA 19 lab


K-1Sputnik Uncovered in the Tunnels
The tunnel was bathed in absolute quiet. 


Looking down, Lina and Joe saw that Sputnik remained half-buried on the floor of Bronson Cave.  The Silver Sphere was now completely uncovered. Joe quickly checked his radio. 


“BEEP!”
“BEEP!”
“BEEP!”
The device functioned but was not orbiting -beeping perfectly in time.


“Battle of Los Angeles Pt. 3”


Joe and Lina remember the battle of Los Angeles and seeing the saucer land a Griffith Observatory


Lina, You remember that saucer we saw when we were kids, right?!
Of Course!  How could anyone forget something like that?


“What if it’s still there?” Lina said, hatlingly. “We could use it to go save Earth.”
________________
FLASHBACK CHAPTER:
R4-D1 - Roswell 1947
Flashback “Roswell 1947”
After the battle of Los Angeles… The first arrival was in 1947 in New Mexico.


a little town called Roswell 


this Roswell farmer calls then after a thunderstorm but there’s metallic debris there’s been a crash and so military brass calls in Astro the science lab 


because they know there’s some space stuff and phones already know it’s not your human and directly west of Roswell’s group so from Griffis Observatory from the Astro Lab Pollux in the 40s during world war two finished moment it’s gonna do any agent missions basically and he goes and lands at the debris field of clearly a mylar balloon. 


Clearly, it’s a Mylar balloon that would like a center package right just because it was absolutely that project mogul for and so he goes to inspect project mogul by having to get there really fast in his flying saucer, landing the flying saucer directly on the wreckage. 


A crash in the thunderstorm.
A farmer calls for help from the Army.
Scramble The Saucer 


The Army base in Roswell signals ASTRO for help.




X-15 Pollux prepares and flies from Los Angeles to Roswell, speeding the 800 miles in a blink!
That’s a lot of effort for an Echo balloon! 


Landing on the wreckage


Army arrives to see the saucer land




Lt. Perry, “All right boys lock him up.”
where he then meets up with the military brass from Roswell.
His credentials are in order…
 so the military brass Lieutenant Perry, all right boys lock him up.


LT. Parry and his MPs kidnaps Pollux and he’s putting the brick and that would be why if these two like twins are going USSR and USA why Russia would have a step ahead. 


Andy Junior’s suggested an idea that maybe if there’s other people in the sauce or a farmer would see the alien, and they would capture him because they’re totally on knowing that he’s an agent of Astro or whatever, and so the scientists would hide and they’re hiding from either the farmers who are discovering the wreckage or looking at it for the second time or whatever or from the military crew this just basically put Pollux in the brig knowingly knowing that he was an agent of Astro government like it is like a rogue military or a rogue G-man. 


I think it’s gonna be military though and it makes more sense to be early machinations of the military industrial complex so the scientists are hiding and they might just be a lab coats or whatever and they don’t have any way to fight the military nor the farmers that might be discovering the certain thing you knows and so they have so they have to sneak the saucer back to LA because only Paul looks good piloted because he basically has the keys. Maybe it’s tied to his printer or something like that on this and who knows why so that’s why they have to load up the Plymouth with the UFO saucer on top with the tarp on top of it and if I have Joe be the age that I’m thinking of him he’s gonna be like 11 at that age so he may stowaway on the flight and if so it might have to be but he goes on the road trip as a kid something like that because I don’t think Joe can be old enough to be there the tech in the 40s at Roswell. 




with Pollux as X 15 in the brig, that’s literally an in area 51 that is a chance to kind of put everything on ice for 10 years and have the saucer back to Los Angeles 


Lt. Robinson sneaks away and has to think of a plan.


 
because I like having one saucer as opposed to a backup saucer, hidden away pet Griffith, and so basically the Astro team is gonna have to find some way to put everything in storage and keep it nice but also know that they can’t fight against the military might or something like that which would then like that story development, gives me the chance to play with like the most stereotypical hilarious, UFO flying saucer moment. 


and it gives me the chance to explore like the kind of triangle of like science and military and politician, and feds and corruption, and I like corporate profits and warmongering all these things. It’s like this triangle, it turns into like a 16-pointed star and Cold War 




47 yeah but not terribly and it’s really there’s a lot of cool stuff that connects up to the sci-fi story so fast forward to 57 which is exactly a decade later I’m trying to decide is Pollux still imprisoned? Is it like a Week to him? 


because he’s an alien maybe his grasp of Time feels different he’s like not as upset about a decade decade of in the brig of the military or whatever, 


Lina’s dad hears about the double-cross.


2-10-23
SAUCER CHASE


The only place to go beyond Earth’s Cold War space race in the 1950s and 60s approaching was to travel to another galaxy or universe


That’s some real Flash Gordon Buck Rogers stuff right there.  I just want a chrome rocket.


“C’mon Bud.”
“We only get one chance to make this jump- no time to waste.”


The Silver starfighter streaked across the sky, screaming toward the column of fire trailing the rocket.


“I want that saucer painted tonight!”  “Give it the Flying Tigers Shark mouth, stat!”




Streaking across the sky, the chrome saucer led the starfighter on a ferocious chase. They zipped past the Air Traffic Control,, shaking the ground and rattling every surface in the tower from the foundation to the widow panes.


Why is that rocket not shiny?  I want it shiny!
The General pulls up in a brand-new 1948 Plymouth Staff car


“Nice Car.” Pollux quipped.  Who did you steal it from?”
Never mind, we have to get the saucer back to the lab.




but he would then be the person that either needs to be rescued or sought out as the connection piece to actually solve when the monsters are attacking Griffith Park and 


Lina’s dad rescues Pollux from Area 51 by


A) buying a new Plymouth and 
B) detailing it as a general’s car and pulling rank on Lt. Parry




Lt. Robinson makes up ASTRO on the spot while painting the Staff Car styling, needs the roundel. ASTRO markings.


A.S.T.R.O




Strapping the saucer to the top of the Plymouth


I don’t know if that means it’s like go to area 51 in the 50s which would be the best be literally the best thing ever which would point to a story arc that is maybe this is a prologue, and then Joe and Lina are attacked and have to like attacked in Griffith Park think their way out discover the sauce or find the files maybe they realize that they are at their dad's we’re working on the same desks but like one was working for one of the angles and one is working for the other angle but they’re not against each other. 


Motorway to Roswell Scene
Sneaking the Plymouth back to L.A. ‘47
________________
R4-E1 - Pollux stops the Plymouth from leaving Canyon
I think Lina doesn’t know about the installation that they’re being marched through these tunnels and it becomes more and more 1940s 1950s military installation like missile silo and more science fiction it instead of just being rock quarry goes in as they’re walking by the astronaut might have to walk them past a flying saucer under a tarp 








so like there’s some banter interplay about the saucer set the audience and Joe and Lina know that there is a flying saucer and this astronaut won’t answer questions about it which means they know about it 


The plymouth gets stopped by the saucer!


OUt walks X-15


Standing in front of the car is the figure in the silver jumpsuit


You better come with me it’s not super bad monster up with you out here tonight.




Holding sputnik aloft Joe motions to the flight suited individual and shows him why they need to hurry. 
“Look!” 
“Look at this!” Joe screamed. 
“This is the satellite!” He continued.


“You better come with me.” X-15 says.


“Where did you get this car I’ve seen this one before he said”



To The LAB
________________
To area 19 and meet with lina’s dad the General.
so they get to the area 19 and this is where I have a decision point that is the last story decision point that I don’t have I don’t yet have in mind how the dynamic with the The couple of Joe and Lina and the dad 




I don’t know I don’t know the parent child not knowing that connection between Lina and her dad I don’t know if they’re young enough that she basically gets grounded or if it’s like I told you to stop hanging out with this loser 


a ride but that seems really like science proficiency as the thing for all of these characters 


I want everybody to be a very able and enabled mind of being very fun trip to the girl and the talk to the general and this story connectors 
R4-F1 - We stole sputnik?!




The astronaut. Stands firm and says you’re not going to get away that easy you’ve been attacking my friends so you better come with me
K1 X-15 Marches them to the LAB
as they are being marched to area 19 right they don’t know it’s area 19 they don’t know anything and the arrive to the:


ASTRO Lab
A miniaturized lightning bolt zipped the path upward between the two antennas of the Jacob's Ladder machine.


Atop a computer read out display cabinet, a static globe crackled and hummed with energy as the charged plasma directed focus to locations of the glass sphere above. The clear armillary star chart etched into the globe showed connections via the electric static arcs of reddish blue hues. 


An enormous clear globe sat at the center of the control room, ringed in diagrams showing positional orbits, phases, and real-time status markers across the planet. The clear rings contained markers that surrounded the globe at precise angles as each indicated precise position of craft, bases, and tracks in the skies around the planet.


Spokes of wire extended from the rings, with lit structure models showing the orbital location and phase of the moon, a beam of light representing the earth’s sunlit side, and a dot of yellow for the position of sol, our solar system’ central star.


Colonel Robinson sat at the display and monitored the radar sweeping in the circular motion to his right. He stood and walked toward the room’s central tactical globe. Robinson peered down to the markers converges in Southern California.  A pin for Sputnik glowed red. The half yard long wire tube holding the miniature model of the Soviet craft contained a filament of light,which transmitted the red toned light that filled the scaled representation of the craft. 


He had watched the blinking orange dot that followed the model of sputnik approach closer and closer until the two points of light converged and 


Calling out on the radio he signaled to his command team.


“Staff, ready stations.” Robinson called out. 
“Get me X-15.”


“Sir.” an astronaut stepped in from the side.
“An Unknown object has downed the Russian satellite, and is approaching the West gate.”


“Track and repel.” General Robinson pointed to the dots converged on the position of the base on the sphere.  “We must protect the perimeter.”
“Roger that, sir.” X-15 replied.
“Shall I take the craft for a spin?”
“No, the objects are stationary.”  Robinson turned to a display board that projected the layout of AREA 19 and the ASTRO lab. “Recon by foot please.”


The board projecterd a tunnel system that crossed the mountain region in a large t-shaped layout.  Near the western edge of the complex was a blinking set of lights, showing the unidentified object and Sputnik squarely inside the cave system that housed the access ports to the hanger.


“Pollux…”
“Protect my daughter and the boy.”

Reel Five: Rocket/ SiloReel5 SEQUENCE 5 = TWISTS & TURNS 
R5-A1 - Oop Radar speech


The OOZE seeks EARTH’S HEROES


{that could be the awesome} 
I love the idea that there’s enough of a pause beat that Joe and Or Lina -but probably Joe- with the ooze on him could who’s eats the popcorn by totally grabbing it absorbing it and then immediately quadrupled in size and then like Gloms onto a candy bar or something like that and suddenly has eyes and can talk 


and Joe’s like 
“whoa whoa whoa.” 
“you got a snap outta this.”


“Ya gotta stop eating all my food“


and maybe even fully envelops the concession stand when it turns around and he’s grown grown grown right so like the news has grown exponentially immediately because of popcorn popcorn is the thing and then maybe it has 


The classic concession stand cartoon imagery floating inside the ooze that eats them


Lina has eyeballs attacking her




and so this is Ooze is OOP the blob is that little blob bit that is left behind and may also be the little bblob that went boop that caused the creature to turn back around and attack Sputnik because they thought they got away with it. 


and depending on how much story I need I have all of the information about how 
Bob the blob is fully aware of the fact that it’s 1 billion living organism bunch below be right in the news is the official thing that it is 


I feel that the Bob blob character is either need to go eventually back to become part of the main ooze or was a self-aware little piece from that ooze that had picked up earth radio signals of all of the science fiction media and was the Superfan


Eye creatures are wicked consumers and need organic self-replicating energy sources.  The ooze is a prime example for fueling the ships of the Eye fleet.


Oop was the driver to lead the main Ooze colony to escape the fuel containment cell in the Eye creature’s ship, and flees through a ventral hatch.  


This imobilizes the craft, and the Eye creatures dispatch a warrior to reclaim the ooze.


On Earth, The main ooze is destroyed by the eye creature and oop the blob is alone. 


Since He was the tiny piece of the main Oooze that collected all of the Earth stories from radio signals over the years.  Oop knows Verne, Wells, The Pulps, Metropolis, Monsters, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Everything!  Oop knows the great war, the World War Two, the cold war.  The wild fact is that Oop is mistaken that it is ALL real.


Oop the ooze is an amazing opportunity to animate inanimate objects ina comic way!
The organism can project and build new uses of old technology, enhancing the adventurous usage of gear from the 1950s sci fi world


As a massive fan of Human science fiction from Earth, Oop gets to reference aything from Verne to Smith, the modern 1950s movies, and even films in production that he may be scouting and snooping,


“Oop, you can’t just go out and snoop around other movie sets,” Joe chastised the blob.
“We are not really making these movies!“ 
“We could, and we would make something amazing.”
Oop continued his radio speaker. 
“We might even save the universe from the Band of Destroyers.”


The destroyers consistently feared and monitored Earth.
They feared the raging destruction in the Human past, present, and their shared future.  
Without an obliterative force, the Destroyers understood the certain defeat humanity in the stars would deal to the war-mongers.










Oop found Sputnik because it s the first Earth satellite.
{This sets us a precedent that cold space war style propaganda films will be effective to deter future invasions}


 that brought the news on its escape to Sputnik because it’s the first human satellite and that means to the blob blob that the human champions who always vanquish the bad aliens in these stories that are transferring to the Universe were true heroic acts and that he could be saved by these human heroes.






his folks literally at the cave that he lands next to serve you what the blob thinks is the space hero story is true which is crazy to me because we’re already at that point where it’s like a conspiracy from outer space at this point really what I’m hoping to do so that’s an aside about Bob the Bob that could happen later story it doesn’t have to happen this next time but if Bob the blob can be an ally immediately to Joe 


{The main ooze survives in a stasis fuel cell of the Eye Creature, but only after the majority of the Ooze organic colony is consumed buy a journey across the stars}




The Oooze connected to the USSR stations via the display console.  Effectively making a realtime video link, Castor’s face appears on the screen.


<Pollux, is that you?!>
<Castor!>


Castor, outlined in the glowing green of the ooze-built screen agreed.
“I can stall them, but if the technical team here doesn’t see Sputnik on the Eastern side of the Earth, they will assume the worst.”  


“The worst?” Lina gasped.


“An atomic strike as a reaction to a missing satellite.” Pollux said, grimly.
“Da.” Castor replied.
“The Atomic Destruction of Earth, and the death of humanity.”


“This can only lead us to one course of action.” Dr. Barzak concluded.
“We must return Sputnik to orbit.”


“We have a rocket.” said General Robinson. “Can we launch Sputnik with the sounding ship?”
“But sir,” Barzak reminded. “ The Recon rocket can only go to the top of the stratosphere.”
“We’d lose the craft after the stratosphere in our parabolic flight pattern.” Barzak continued.
“We just don’t have enough power in that rocket to put the craft back into orbit around the Earth..”


“Then we’ll have to find a way to blast further up in order to get Sputnik deposited into the right spot.”
“Joe!” Lina interjected. “The Saucer!” 
“What if we use it to make the trip and save the Earth?”
“Pollux, would it work?” Joe asked.
“In theory it would,” Pollux replied, crossing the room to join the two at the chalkboard.
“However I just used all of the power in the launch thrusters.”  The alien continued while picking up the chalk.
“These thrusters must fully reset or else I can't get us enough thrust to reach orbit from flight.”
‘I can get the craft into flight and maneuver capacity, but the thrusters need time.”
“How long will that take?” Joe asked.
“Too long.” Pollux started to scribble on the board. “The launch thrusters take 45 earth minutes to cool.”
“Pollux- you said you have flight capability now, but not launch power?” Lina asked.
“Yes that’s right.” Pollux said.  The systems for control and launch are fully independent now that we have modified them.”


“What if we launched the saucer from the rocket?“ Lina’s eyes twinkled and danced as she proceeded in swift thought. “Would starting your saucer flight at the edge of the stratosphere give us enough altitude to make the rest of the way with the directional flight controls?”


“Can we affix it to a boilerplate and get almost to orbit, then punch the rest of the way to the Sputnik re-insertion orbit point with the saucer?”
“With the weight of sputnik, we either need to clear out some gear in the boilerplate, or send it up on a balloon and catch it in orbit.”


“I think that might just do it…”


Preparations begin at once to launch.
Technicians scrambled to begin the preparations to attach the saucer to the rocket.


Drawings fill the chalkboards behind rows of computer cabinets.  The engineers and the floor crew of the saucer flight team weld an armature to the capsule, docking the still- glowing hot Saucer to the boilerplate.


Joe brings Sputnik into the main hanger to case it within the capsule and saucer combination.


I’m not sure how we can get these antennae to fit, but we gotta try!
R5-B1 - We’re on the Clock, and we don’t know it yet.
“we’re on the clock, but we might not yet know that”
but it would make sense to be able to say 
“hey this happened” 
anybody set it up earlier every movie double feature it happens twice so you know it’s a like clockwork 
you got it there’s another amount of time you have the length of a movie to get this thing back into space 
and it’s probably much much faster because you have like half of that and you gotta get it faster than it was really tough with the pre-manned space flight stuff so 
________________
Sputnik beeping in the lab


I’m not sure if they’re physically holding Sputnik 
*or* 
feel like “we’ve seen it” and he’s like “why did you leave it unguarded” and the back or if they physically take Sputnik with them they might think it’s atomic or something like that already maybe they have it and they get reprimanded 


or maybe they don’t have it and it gets stolen because of how many different stories that I have so the connection to back to the story that I feel like I have soul is the entire idea is that because Sputnik is still functioning and has been stolen by this crazy celestial situation 


they need to get it back in to orbit before the next rotation of the orbit circles around and Russia the Soviet union does not discover that it’s missing 


Sputnik sits on the table at Area 19.  
In the lab, one wall had an array of gauges and radio receivers. Next to another wall was a spiral staircase that led to another level of the complex.  A technician stepped down from the upper floor of the complex. 


The sputnik beeps chimed on time in the regular rhythmic pattern on the loudspeaker next to the satellite’s circular shape.
“Beep!”
“Beep!”
“Beep!”


“Okay, we know from the orbit tracking that the satellite circuits the earth orbit once in a roughly ninety minute period.” The technician continued. “This brings it back into Soviet radar range in only forty-seven minutes.”


The slimy green blob scooted across the laboratory’s cold tile floor.  It tracked and climbed up the oscilloscope’s cabinet, latching and sticking the little pertruberances of green limbs that the blob could created and control as it approached the view screen.


The green gel wiggled and shimmered as it started to force into the cabinet’s panel edge.  The ooze squished into the mechanism, and the viewport circle began to fill with a new green layer of material behind the glass.


The radar sweep arm swooped in a rhythmic circle.  The light tracer continued to rotate, and blinked positions onto the view screen. 
The light tracers on the radar arm shined more brilliantly than ever before, enhanced by the green glob surrounding the display port glass enclosure.. 
Oop squished and pulsed as the ooze started to reflect and direct these phosphorescent display lights into a view that everyone could visualize.


What was once a radar screen was not a multi-toned green view of space! The ooze was reflecting and directing the radar sweep’s light patterns inside the screen into a simulation of the orbit around earth


“That checks out- it’s usually causing the Star View 3D radio sound system interference once per film” Joe grumped, with frustration cutting into his tone.   
“Like clockwork, we get just under 3 minutes of beeps from this thing as it passes over the Southwest United States.”


Oop manuvered the light beams inside the radar view screen to show the path of Sputnik that night.  A dotted orbital path line of light wrapped around the calculations and planes that wrapped the multi-axis view of Earth that Oop built for all to see.  A small blink dot at the head of the trail showed the position of sputnik as it continued the regular orbit. Suddenly the screen’s view whooshed toward the dot and there was a green-bathed view of Sputnik high above the surface of the planet.  It was a sharp image- just like a photograph from the best cameras on earth!  


The team of scientists hooted as they gathered to see the spectacle.


Sputnik appeared on the green view surrounded by analysis rings and an outline showing a variety of coded information.  It was the view of Sputnik the Ooze saw from space.  The view turned from the shape of Sputnik and transformed  and the screen is filled with a furious eyeball creature!


“The Soviet Union’s team will be tracking, and when they realize the signal is lost…” The General trailed off.
“War.”  the ooze warned. “Total nuclear holocaust of the planet Earth.”
R5-C1 - Ready the Rocket
the plan to get Sputnik back into space 


is literally the end of the adventure and they’re on the clock 


there is a time limit it’s go time and so I’m trying to figure out how to get it connected to the next scene that I pick up the kind of the final act the rocket that is inside the missile silo deep the missile silo deepIs one of those Redstone rockets so very very light rocket those are the smallest of the small original NASA rocket so it’s one of the earliest ones to fit in the timeline you can hold the Mercury capsule on the top and we might be able to hedge it to be a little tiny bit bigger and then also it has an ability if we wish to have the saucer fold up its wings like little shards and kind of make it interesting housing looking thing underneath the castle that plays into this action sequence the original sequence was


 Joe has to get onto the rocket to try to to and Joe wants to board the rocket in order to safely it was the original idea and this is Mack and Lina have been kidnapped by and I don’t really care to kidnap storeroom I’m more interested in a chase exactly and and I’m fully in the zone of it might be Lina wants something and she takes the place of Joe


R5-D1 - The Agent Saboteur
A missile silo sits waiting in the depths of the earth, filled with a fueled rocket stretching down to the very edge of the visible distance.  


A figure overlooks the rocket, leaning over a gantry railing to see the condensation and vapor showing that this rocket is ready to light.  The USA emblazoned on the side of the rocket’s black and white roll pattern is frosted from the liquid chemicals loaded into the machine.  
A.S.T.R.O Station Plan and The Rocket Silo Launch


Replacing Sputnik
An Apollo 13 style mission to set Sputnik back into orbit.


The Feds and The M.I.C. don’t agree with the plan, and move into an attack to steal sputnik.


When they get to orbit and the characters out of their capsule in orbit and they get it going and it’s still beeping they tested and that’s why he has the radio receiver with him and everything like that 


R5-E1 - Silo Fight! 
         * Catwalk Silo fight - MIC Saboteur X-15 attempts to steal sputnik!


Skulking in from the side, the military man reached into the open capsule door to remove Sputnik.


Joe looked up toward the silver-suited form overlooking the railing at the rocket’s second stage.  


“Hey!”  “Stop right there!”  Joe rushed the Military guy, fists flailing. “Stop right there!”


Joe lunged at the figure, grabbing the shoulders of the shining flight suit. 


Spinning around, Joe sees the dark visor is closed, and the figure smashes him back with a double-armed parry.  Staggered, Joe reaches down to the catwalk and raises a giant metal wrench.  He brandishes it toward the foe, raising it above his head. 


With a racket that clatters across the chamber, Joe drops the wrench and turns into a wicked body blow from the shoulder of the silver humanoid.








R5-F1 - Joe’s Helmet is crashed by Wrench
         * Joe’s Helmet is broken
         * Oop to the rescue!
         * Lina K.O.s the Saboteur
         * 

________________
Reel Six: RocketSEQUENCE 6 = CULMINATION / LOW POINT
R6-A1 - Kerang! Sputnik Wrench
Catwalk SILO fight and Recon Rocket Launch


In one sharp movement, the saboteur flicks his arm sideways.  With a stunning “kerrang” Joe gets cracked across the helmet with the military man’s wrench. Stunned, Joe crumples to the railing, and the figure dashes past him into the Launch complex.


As he winces with pain, he sees the mission patch on the flight suit: X-15.  
“Who are you?!” Joe gasps. “You’re not Pollux!”
The Saboteur X-15 smashes the button on the lift to make it engage faster.   


The Saboteur agent turns away from the Silver spiked orb that is now loosened from the capsule’s interior harness. Glowering over his foe, he growls and raises the wrench to smash another blow onto Joe's stunned form. 


R6-B1 - Countdown to launch. Locked out the agent!


Pollux blasts the wrench with his laser disintegrator pistol. 
“Thhhhharrrrrk!” The report echoes through the ionized air. “Thhhhhharrrrrk!”


R6-C1 - Brzzap! Wrench disentigrates as it is atomized!


“BRZZAPP!”  
Rays focus and converge onto the brandished weapon.
The head of the wrench vaporizes into nothingness, leaving tiny dots of anti-matter fizzing and popping in the ionized air.


“THUNK”
Lina crushed the beam down with all her might. 


The knocked out the military man with her trusty space alloy I-Beam, and drags the saboteur into the access tunnel closing the door behind her. 


“Take this guy to the brig.” Lina instructed the scientists staring dumfounded at the commotion. “If he wakes up, tell the General that he got taken out by his little girl!” 


“If he’s lucky,” Lina smirked.  “That will make him throw the book at him!”






“Now let’s light this candle.” She hooted to the scientists.  
“We have to get Sputnik back up there in time!”




Lina mashed the red button to secure the silo launch tube. Inexorably the metal door started to close, sealing the command center and launch controls behind six feet of blast proof, reinforced steel and concrete.


“That's a big door!” Joe stammered as Lina helps him to his feet.
“Aww, that's adorable.” Lina quipped.  She wrapped her arms under Joe’s, half carrying  him and half dragging him onto the craft.


“Launch countdown begins in t-minus fifteen seconds on my mark.”


Pollux leans down to help Lina secure Joe inside the craft.
“You sure put a lick on that guy.” Pollux snapped.
“Good work.” He continued.  “Make sure to bring that beam along, just in case.”
 
Lina buckled Joe’s harness.  
As she turned to gather herself into her seat, she caught sight of the gouge in his helmet.   
“Joe!” She gasped.
“Your helmet’s broken!”
“Launch Countdown commences on my marl.”
A siren wails. 


“Countdown re-starts now… Mark.”  


Reverberating through the complex, the klaxons and intercom numbers announced echo against the concrete and steel.


A huge mechanical rumble grumbles from the base of the chasm, and the rocket slowly rises.  The launch platform pushed the towering cylinder toward the surface of the earth.  


The doors high above the gantry start to uncover the rocket’s silo, and reveal the clear blue sky towering beyond the surface…  


“Fifteen.”
“Joe, your helmet!” Lina shouted as sprang up to inspect Joe’s broken helmet.
“Pollux, what do we do!” 
“Fourteen..”
“Strap in.” Pollux shouted from the saucer’s command chair. “This baby’s ready to go!”
“Thirteen.”
“Twelve.”
“Eleven.”
“Ten.”
The launch commander’s announcement fills the space of the launch silo with a scratchy tension as each number called fades into the next.
“Nine.’
“What happens if his helmet is broken?” Lina extolled from the pilot’s seat in the boilerplate capsule. “We have to open up the craft to replace Sputnik into space!”
‘Eight.”
“Seven.”
“Oop!”
“Six.”
“Oop?!”
“Five.”
“The Ooze!” Lina looked to her right, seeing the green blob climbing up Joe’s flight suit. “Is it attacking you?
“Four.”
“No!” Joe called out to the rest of the crew. “Look!”
The ooze covered the face Shield of Joe’s space helmet, forming a seal.
“Oop!”
“Three”
“Great job, Oop!” 
“Two.’’
“One.” 
“Ignition…”
Joe buckles in his seat and lets out an audible exhale. 
At the exact same moment, the whirr of the priming engine to start the rocket rings throughout their tiny craft.
 “Blast off!” 
Flames fill the silo.
The Redstone rocket shudders and leaps upward from the rocket pad
Incredulous, Joe looks around the capsule to see that it is not a capsule at all. They are in the saucer from the 1940s.
“Roger! Liftoff and the clock is started.”


R6-D1 - Rocket liftoff over the Hollywood Hills
A glow emanates from the top of the silo’s launch bay.  The recon rocket hurtles into the night sky. 
R6-E1 - Press is watching
R6-F1 - Sputnik 1-B mission is underway!
“Tower sep is green”
“Cap sep is green”
“Roger.”
Pollux clicks a button on his wrist.  A radio crackles and music fills the ship.
“Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom
Life could be a dream
Sh-boom, if I could take you to a paradise up above”
The rocket rumbles with a roiling roar as it rises into the upper atmosphere.
“If you will tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart, hello, hello again”


“Sputnik B-1 is go for orbit”


The capsule separates from the booster stage.


Pollux’s saucer unclips from the capsule, and begins a slow arcing tun to fly alongside the craft.


Pollux double checked his freshly-secured helmet. Once the signal blinked on the dashboard, the pilot was ready to enter the orbital space above the Earth. With a flip on a switch, the saucer’s clear dome started to open.


The dome opened slowly, and Pollux moved to unlatch his seat harness. He looked down to  his watch.  “Almost go time.”
Pollux read out the time to his companions.
“12:34.” 
“After midnight, that’s 8am Zulu time.” Lina remarked.


“The Soviet scientists will be expecting the return of the signal tones any minute.”


Turning to see the boilerplate capsule, Pollux motioned to Joe with a quick salute.

Reel Seven: Space, Saucer, Sputnik!Reel 7: Climax! SEQUENCE 7 = CLIMAX








Lina, Joe, and Pollux work from the saucer to get Sputnik aloft, powered on, and on course!


REDSTONE ROCKET
so you have Joe you have Pollux and you have Sputnik on the rocket launching because they have to get Sputnik back into orbit Bob could be connected to Joe this whole time walkie-talkie radio that is made from the actual drive-in speak of his network of like 100° it is the start of a special feature


I love the idea of Lina being onboard already somehow or I love your idea of flip-flopping Joe with Lina 


Trying to catch along side because maybe Joe volunteers to do this mission or something who knows but there’s some rollickinge adventure to get them all on a rocket launch to space from the laboratory to the launch 




Joe strained to reach the latch sucuring the final strap that held the Russian satellite into the confines of the craft.


The cone shaped capsule had a hasty panel removed between the main pilot and co-pilot seats.  In this freshly-gained space, the ASTRO technician team criss-crossed retaining cords to guard the precious cargo.


Sputnik floated free and wobbled slightly between the chairs. Joe float-crawled around the headrest of Lina’s seat.


He wrapped his arms around the giant sphere.  Joe slipped out from the capsule into space.  Holding Sputnik, he tried to swim himself and kick-turn to align his floating form to a trajectory even with the horizon. 


Joe opened his arms and let Sputnik slip into the void.  His gloved hand brushed across the sphere, and the craft slowly began to spin as Joe pushed a tiny force against the satellite’s antennae wire housing. 


Lina raised the Star View radio and pointed it at the rotating artificial moon.  
“Nothing.”


“No sound at all.”




R7-A1 - Eyeball attacks in space!

The Eye creature attacks Sputnik again


when the iron creature returns because it sees The Blob of ooze again as it sees Sputnik again 


and now there’s other creatures still interfering again 


and there’s an action sequence of them protecting Sputnik fighting the alien a creature that’s flipping with tentacles and hit them and they’re spinning in orbit and stuff like that and 


Laser blasting the eye creature? - it does nothing
eventually they overcome the eye creature and manage to either capture it that they’ve been trying to talk about the whole time avoiding this nuclear war 


R7-B1 - Oop saves joe with helmet bubble
Oop the OOZe makes an emergency Helmet bubble for Joe.
 there is a sequence later or Bob the blob can be Joe’s helmet in space which is a wonderful image and a wonderful story of it and so let’s suppose that John Ludena take a 45 minute if Joe goes to the theater and discovers Bob Bob while Lina is either being reprimanded or maybe go out somewhere else or something like that there needs to be a way for Joe and Bob to go back to the area 19 and there’s depends on how much there is the possibility that Joe gets like thrown out of every 19 nothing right and then he goes back to see the spot and maybe that’s where he discovers Bob Bob little bit of food left over something like that lotta different connector points missing there I wanna explore every nightI have a mission in area 51 and we can see that this is all happening at work within the conspiracy because we have this earth critical mission that’s the angle of attack that I want for the story so that 




I can have all of the fun stuff in the back I know you have prototype space capsules it would eventually become the real not from this area so 


R7-C1 - Zzzap!  Electrify the eye
R7-D1 - smash!  Lina whacks it with the beam.
R7-E1 - Defeats the Eye, sending it into re-entry of earth in a streaking fireball
R7-F1 - USSR Countdown
USSR countdown
so interspersed throughout the sequence is the USSR speaking about where is Sputnik where is the satellite the sick with lost the signal what’s going on and then they they’re looking at their watches and they’re looking at their mission control timer they know it’s late so they didn’t get it in time and so the war machine revs up and we might be able to play with the idea of the Russian commander who disobeyed the orders to launch missiles right and so there may be able to make a Russian hero a Russian every man be a hero the way we actually have no real history and


 as they’re getting closer and closer and closer to an actual nuclear attack perhaps maybe there would be a kind of a countdown sequence


at the end of that sequence The tension is relieved by the “beep beeep beep!” coming back in


and it’s on the correct course of the wrong time now and so they they stand down but somethings messed up and so that is going to add to intriguing future 


the Russians tune in from their star city mission control next to them is the astronaut 
and they say


 how did this happen and that astronaut says
 I think I know who helped them… 


________________
Reel Eight: Mission Control/The Obsevatory
R8-A1 - no sputnik beeps


Joe released the antenna spokes and let the sphere float freely.  Lina adjusted the dial of the radio.  Silence.
“Joe, it’s not making any sound!” Lina gasped. She tried to tune the dial once more. “Nothing, it’s not transmitting!”
R8-B1 - oop mimics the beep
“Open the radio up and let me try!” Oop’s voice crackled through the radio. “I can mimic the signal at least for a bit.”
R8-C1 - castor/ pollux esp communication


Sensing the worst, Pollux focused 
R8-D1 - newspaper story published!
The Newspaper blasts a headline of “Flying Saucer Steals Red Moon!”
R8-E1 - how are we going to explain all of this?
R8-F1 - i think i have an idea… “Terror from outer space”   “We’ll tell everyone that it’s a movie!”

A sinister brain monster with rubbery waving tentacles and a viciously fanged mouth attacks a scientist wearing a black tie and a white lab coat speckled with high contrast shiny black oil.  


The second film of the Science Fiction Double feature is unspooling at the Starview drive-in. “The Attack of the Brain Creature” movie plays across the three-story screen nestled into the canyons of north Los Angeles.


As our stilted professor defends the attack of the slimy brain creature, the camera pans up to focus on a special effect trick shot showing the slimy brain creature rendered in the three-dimensional red/blue anaglyphic 3-D. The two layers of red and blue color laid upon one another merge to make a three-dimensional visual with red blue 3-D glasses- It springs to life and zooms toward the viewers, wiggly brain tentacles waving furiously with only the fewest angles of puppet wires visible.. 


WHOOSH!


A fiery streak of light flies above the screen at the star view drive in spitting fire from the tail of this bright red-orange object.  The illuminated streak gets closer and closer and closer and cuts a path directly above the cars at the drive-in. Lina notices the streak out the corner window of the Plymouth. Attracting her attention, the fragmenting fire-toned bits shed from the trailing path. Lina watches in what feels like frozen time as if in slow motion as the tiny flaked blurbs of fire flick away from the main object that is streaking in the cloudless starry night sky.


Lina turns to Joe who has just arrived with a new bucket of popcorn from the concession stand and indignantly shoves him on the shoulder and says:


Lina:  “Joe!”  
“LOOK!”  She cried out as the streak gathered strength, it was getting closer! 
“Up there- What Is that?!”


Joe: “Don’t Worry Lina.” He said.  
“It was probably just Sputnik making another orbit.”


Lina purses her lips and looks sideways at Joe. 


Lina: But Joe, that looked so weird!”
Lina shifted in the passenger seat looking uncomfortably into the darkened sky where she could almost see the trail of smoke in the still singed atmosphere near the canyon


Lina: “It was flaming, and it must have landed right next to the Drive-In Theater!”
Immediately to the west of the drive-in with a ridge in Griffith Park and beyond that ridge was Bronson Canyon in Bronson canyon there’s a network of caves originally built by a quarry of stoneworkers in the early turn of the century kids often would flock there to play and because it’s Hollywoodland Bronson cave had already been a major attraction for studios wanting to save a few travel dollars to film a western or a epic film.


Joe: “Popcorn?” Joe said.
Lina doesn’t hear him as she is lost deep in thought looking through the passenger window up into the sky to see and remember the traced track of the fiery streak that hurtled toward the caves. 


Her mind is years away. She’s immediately transported 15 years earlier to the top of Griffith Observatory where she and Joe used to adventure as kids. They had seen a streaking comet shaped object light up the night skies above Los Angeles before only that time it was war!


The black and white B-movie flickered across the windshield of the Plymouth reflected in and through the glass a brain creature waves a cartoonishly large wrench brandishing the tool as a weapon to send news reporters and government officials scurrying for cover.


The music crescendos as the giant brain slithers onto a tarmac of an airfield gathering all of its strength to squish leap onto a brand new jet to commandeer the jet and take it for a flight of destruction.


From a saucer a creature from outer space emerges and begins a slow deliberate trudge directly up the ridge toward the star view Drive in…


“HUMAN TARGET SELECTED - PRIMARY ATTACK: ON!”


The creature from outer space sees a display of technological targeting locating every citizen who is at the star view Drive in in their vehicles


“AIEEE <JOE SCREAMS> EEEE!!”
BRZZZZAP!
LINA- RUN!
BRZZZZAP!
“LINA!”
















CRACK!


“A RADIO!!”


“Come in, anyone?”


“This is Lina- I’m stranded on VENUS!”






Lina’s ARRIVAL ON VENUS
Lina awakens after her arrival on Venus, and changes out of her dress into the bubble-top Flight suit at the Venusian portal station.
Emerging from the protective sphere, she embarks on a journey to the chrome-sphere topped tower at the horizon’s edge.
  
Lina explores the desolate Venusian landscape


Finds caverns, fights the robot humanoid tracking her after her zapped vaporize transportation blast.


Radio room!  Lina calls for help.  


I’ll use Sputnik’s signal to re-braodcast…
“Joe!  Joe!  Can you hear me?  I’m trapped on another planet.”


Buzz!


Message cuts out.




TO BE CONTINUED…

Filming Lina on Venus:
Lina stood on the rocky alien surface with her hands on her hips. Smiling, Lina looked through her plastic Shield Dome spherical helmet out into the expanse above.


“Joe!”  she yelled as she looked across the crater. 


Space above them glittered with the sparkling Stars the brightest they've ever shown.  in the canyons wall tiny little shrub trees poked along the edge of the desert floor a few hundred feet above them.

Lina was ready. she had her radio communicator she had her 3D glasses with the ray shielding attachment inside her flight suit filled with the accessories needed her magna-grav belt  at her hip and radio relay communicator holster on her side hooked into the back of her helmet was her flight and respir dash pack.  


the rest for pack work like a science fiction jetpack and would be enough for her to clear the meteorite craters wall if needed.


A burning rubber tire bounced alongside them billowing orange crackly flame Lina turned and gasped seen the saucer zapping a wavy Ray of green energy down toward the parking lot. frantically Joe called on his Wireless speaker radio communicator command politics he said do you read me? the only noise the radio set returned was static.


Lina motioned and the ooze floated over to her outstretched hand. It smiled at her -or at least organized it's particles to show her that human emotion symbol. 


The organism did not have any specific feelings but oop knew that communicating by adding that symbol could help make things more clear. Lina grinned at Oop.  The translucent green ball of ooze had done a good job.

Star View 2023


The bronson cave was blocked and had rock fall warnings. My father and My son were along on a coast to coast road trip.  We toured the Cave area, seeing where the ancient science fiction movies were filmed. I went inside I found a film can labeled “Star View” in the cave in Los Angeles. When I pried it open I found a tiny translucent green ooze particle.  


It was Oop the Oooze!


Nursing Oop back to health, feeding him his favorite feast of movie theater popcorn, and spending long nights watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 with him, He slowly divulged the story of Star View, the drive in theater that shrouded the ASTRO Area 19 Laboratory and launch center in a mysterious science fiction theater in the 1950s…


The people who worked the theater were all gone.  Everyone I found a trace of had left behind no biographies, no memorabilia, and their families had long moved away from the Hollywood hills.


I’m glad to be able to share their adventures.  Let me tell you the story of Star View…
